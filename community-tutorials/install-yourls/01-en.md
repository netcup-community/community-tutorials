# Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to install YOURLS.

I am doing this on a Debian 11 server (RS Zimtstern) but the installation procedure should also work on other Debian versions.

# Requirements

You need Apache2, PHP and MariaDB installed on your server, see [here](https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/community-tutorials/install-web-server-mariadb-debian-php/01-en.md).

## Installing YOURLS

YOURLS is an open source URL shortener with a web GUI. <br>

- Follow Step [1.5](https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/community-tutorials/install-web-server-mariadb-debian-php/01-en.md#step-15-installing-a-configuration-for-the-web-server) and create a new domain or subdomain for the website. <br>
- Switch to the folder you have just created (replace FOLDER with the name of the folder) by executing the following commands:

```sh
cd /var/www/
git clone https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS.git
mv YOURLS FOLDER
cd FOLDER
```

- Create a database for the web service [(see Step 1.7)](https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/community-tutorials/install-web-server-mariadb-debian-php/01-en.md#step-17---creating-a-database-optional).<br>

Now we have to configure YOURLS:

```sh
cd user
cp config-sample.php config.php
nano config.php
```

You need to make the following changes: <br>

- Replace `'your db user name'` with your database username.

```
/** MySQL database username */
define( 'YOURLS_DB_USER', 'your db user name' );
```

- Replace `'your db password'` with your database password.

```
/** MySQL database password */
define( 'YOURLS_DB_PASS', 'your db password' );
```

- Replace `'yourls'` with your database name (username).

```
/** The name of the database for YOURLS
 ** Use lower case letters [a-z], digits [0-9] and underscores [_] only */
define( 'YOURLS_DB_NAME', 'yourls' );
```

- Replace `'http://your-own-domain-here.com'` with your URL.

```
/** YOURLS installation URL
 ** All lowercase, no trailing slash at the end.
 ** If you define it to "http://sho.rt", don't use "http://www.sho.rt" in your browser (and vice-versa)
 ** To use an IDN domain (eg http://héhé.com), write its ascii form here (eg http://xn--hh-bjab.com) */
define( 'YOURLS_SITE', 'http://your-own-domain-here.com' );
```

- Replace `modify this text with something random` with random letters and numbers.

```
/** A random secret hash used to encrypt cookies. You don't have to remember it, make it long and complicated
 ** Hint: copy from http://yourls.org/cookie */
define( 'YOURLS_COOKIEKEY', 'modify this text with something random' );
```

- Now you need to create a user and define a (secure) password. Replace `'username' => 'password', `.

```
/** Username(s) and password(s) allowed to access the site. Passwords either in plain text or as encrypted hashes
 ** YOURLS will auto encrypt plain text passwords in this file
 ** Read http://yourls.org/userpassword for more information */
$yourls_user_passwords = [
	'username' => 'password',
	// 'username2' => 'password2',
	// You can have one or more 'login'=>'password' lines
];
```

- Save your changes by pressing <kbd>CTRL + X</kbd>, then <kbd>y</kbd> and finally by hitting <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. <br/>
- Open YOURLS by accessing https://DOMAIN/admin and follow the steps shown to log in.

### Step 1.1 - Remove unneeded sample files

Remove sample files no longer needed by executing: <br/>

```sh
cd /var/www/FOLDER
rm sample*
cd user/plugins
rm -r sample*
```

### Step 1.2 - Update YOURLS

- Switch to the YOURLS folder.
- Replace "FOLDER" in the next command with the YOURLS folder and execute the following commands:

```sh
cd /var/www/FOLDER
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
```

### Step 1.3 - Installing a modern YOURLS theme (sleeky)(optional)

- Switch to the YOURLS folder.
- Replace "FOLDER" in the next command with the folder of YOURLS and run:

```sh
cd /var/www/FOLDER/user/plugins
git clone https://github.com/Flynntes/Sleeky.git
mv Sleeky/sleeky-backend/ ./
rm -r Sleeky
```

- Now go to https://DOMAIN/admin and activate the sleeky plugin under the "Plugins" tab. <br>

#### Step 1.3.1 - Update sleeky

- Switch to the YOURLS folder.
- Replace "FOLDER" in the next command with the folder of YOURLS and run:

```sh
cd /var/www/FOLDER/user/plugins
rm -r sleeky-backend
git clone https://github.com/Flynntes/Sleeky.git
mv Sleeky/sleeky-backend/ ./
rm -r Sleeky
```
