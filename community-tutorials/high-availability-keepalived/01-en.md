# Introduction

High availability (HA) refers to the ability of a system to continue operating with a high probability despite the failure of one of its components. There are several applications that help us to achieve high availability. In this tutorial we will use [Keepalived](https://github.com/acassen/keepalived), an application for load balancing and high availability, which uses the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP; [RFC5798](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5798)).

Keepalived is used as a daemon that monitors the system state or certain conditions to automatically fail over to a standby system if an error occurs. We will additionally use a [netcup Failover IPv4](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=1073) and a [Cloud vLAN Free](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2284).

Please note that this is not a tutorial for absolute beginners. I use references to other tutorials or the official documentation of the applications used. If instructions already exist, I see no reason to write them again. So the main point here is how to implement a high availability setup with the mentioned products in the netcup environment.

This tutorial can also be used as a starting point for other distributions, but some modifications will be required.

# Requirements

- 2 servers: Either [vServers](https://www.netcup.de/vserver/vps.php) or [root servers](https://www.netcup.de/vserver/) with Debian installed
- [Failover IPv4](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=1073)
- [Cloud vLAN Free](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2284) (or higher)
- Access to your [Customer Control Panel (CCP)](https://www.customercontrolpanel.de) & [Server Control Panel (SCP)](https://www.servercontrolpanel.de)
- Access to a user with root privileges.

I assume that you have already ordered the mentioned products and fulfill the stated requirements. I will simply refer to the two servers as server 1 (s1) and server 2 (s2). If I do not specify a particular server, it means that the commands must be executed on both servers.

# Step 1 - Set up Cloud vLAN

## Step 1.1 - Preparation

### Step 1.1.1 - Log in to your [SCP](https://www.servercontrolpanel.de), either directly or via the autologin feature in your [CCP](https://www.customercontrolpanel.de).

### Step 1.1.2 - Choose a server (from the list on the top left side).

### Step 1.1.3 - Navigate to the _Network_ section (in the left sidebar).

### Step 1.1.4 - Choose _add Ethernet Interface_ (on the top right side).

### Step 1.1.5 - Select your Cloud vLAN and choose _virtio_ as the driver.

### Step 1.1.6 - Select the second server and repeat steps 1.1.3 - 1.1.5; then continue with 1.2.

## Step 1.2 - Create interface

Log in to your servers and create a vLAN configuration for the network interface using your favorite text editor, e.g. `sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces.d/vlan.cfg`:

**Example _/etc/network/interfaces.d/vlan.cfg_ for s1**

```
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
    address 10.132.0.10
    netmask 255.255.255.0
```

**Example _/etc/network/interfaces.d/vlan.cfg_ for s2**

```
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
    address 10.132.0.20
    netmask 255.255.255.0
```

## Step 1.3 - Restart networking

```
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

## Step 1.4 - Verify vLAN setup

There are various methods to verify that your vLAN is set up correctly. For example, you could start with a simple check using `ip addr show`:

```
3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether e6:1c:ef:12:66:ae brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.132.0.10/24 brd 10.132.0.255 scope global eth1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::e41c:efff:fe12:66ae/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Next to your other network interfaces, you can already see our newly configured interface _eth1_ on s1 with IP 10.132.0.10, which we previously set in the _vlan.cfg_.

Continue with a simple ping between s1 and s2 to ensure that you actually have a working connection:

```
operator@s1:~$ ping 10.132.0.20 -c 5

PING 10.132.0.20 (10.132.0.20) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.132.0.20: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.450 ms
64 bytes from 10.132.0.20: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.510 ms
64 bytes from 10.132.0.20: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.403 ms
64 bytes from 10.132.0.20: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.379 ms
64 bytes from 10.132.0.20: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=0.402 ms

--- 10.132.0.20 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 104ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.379/0.428/0.510/0.053 ms
```

Then also check if the connection works in the reverse direction from s2 to s1. Now that we have confirmed our vLAN configuration, we can continue with the rest of our setup.

# Step 2 - Setup Failover IPv4

## Step 2.1 - Preparation

### Step 2.1.1 - Log in to your [SCP](https://www.servercontrolpanel.de) either directly or via the [CCP](https://www.customercontrolpanel.de).

### Step 2.1.2 - Navigate to _Options_ (on the top right side).

### Step 2.1.3 - Navigate to _Webservice_ (in the left sidebar).

### Step 2.1.4 - Activate the Webservice and set a secure _Webservice Password_.

### Step 2.1.5 - Assign Failover IP.

We determine that s1 should be our master server and therefore we want to assign the Failover IP to s1: Open the SCP, make sure to choose s1 and then navigate to _Network_ in the left sidebar. You should see your Failover IPv4 in the IPv4 section. Assign it to your server by clicking on _Route IP to Server_.

## Step 2.2 - Call netcup Webservice to change routing

We now create a script on both servers that will make a call to the [netcup Webservice](https://www.netcup-wiki.de/wiki/Netcup_SCP_Webservice) to change the routing of our Failover IP in case of an error situation. This script is needed in our Keepalived configuration, which you will see in a moment.

**to_master.sh**

```
#!/usr/bin/bash

CURL_REROUTE='
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ns1="http://enduser.service.web.vcp.netcup.de/">
    <SOAP-ENV:Body>
        <ns1:changeIPRouting>
            <loginName>YOUR_LOGIN_NAME</loginName>
            <password>YOUR_WEBSERVICE_PASSWORD</password>
            <routedIP>YOUR_FAILOVER_IP</routedIP>
            <routedMask>32</routedMask>
            <destinationVserverName>YOUR_VSERVER_NAME</destinationVserverName>
            <destinationInterfaceMAC>YOUR_VSERVER_MAC</destinationInterfaceMAC>
        </ns1:changeIPRouting>
    </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>'

CURL_CHECK='
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ns1="http://enduser.service.web.vcp.netcup.de/">
    <SOAP-ENV:Body>
        <ns1:getVServerIPs>
            <loginName>YOUR_LOGIN_NAME</loginName>
            <password>YOUR_WEBSERVICE_PASSWORD</password>
            <vserverName>YOUR_VSERVER_NAME</vserverName>
        </ns1:getVServerIPs>
    </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>'

REROUTE_RESULT=$(curl -s -H "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8" -H "SOAPAction:" -d "$CURL_REROUTE" -X POST https://www.servercontrolpanel.de:443/WSEndUser?xsd=1)
CHECK_RESULT=$(curl -s -H "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8" -H "SOAPAction:" -d "$CURL_CHECK" -X POST https://www.servercontrolpanel.de:443/WSEndUser?xsd=1)
FAILOVER_IP_ACTIVE=$(echo $CHECK_RESULT | grep YOUR_FAILOVER_IP | wc -l)

n=0
while [ $n -lt 10 ] && [ $FAILOVER_IP_ACTIVE -eq 0 ]
do
    REROUTE_RESULT=$(curl -s -H "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8" -H "SOAPAction:" -d "$CURL_REROUTE" -X POST https://www.servercontrolpanel.de:443/WSEndUser?xsd=1)
    sleep 3
    CHECK_RESULT=$(curl -s -H "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8" -H "SOAPAction:" -d "$CURL_CHECK" -X POST https://www.servercontrolpanel.de:443/WSEndUser?xsd=1)
    FAILOVER_IP_ACTIVE=$(echo $CHECK_RESULT | grep YOUR_FAILOVER_IP | wc -l)
    n=$((n+1))
done
```

The above script changes the routing of the Failover IPv4 to the specified server. If the rerouting does not work for any reason, the script tries again until the maximum tries (in this case 10) are reached. Make sure to use your actual data wherever needed and to make the script executable with `sudo chmod +x to_master.sh`.

Hints:

- _YOUR_LOGIN_NAME_ is your customer id.
- _YOUR_WEBSERVICE_PASSWORD_ is the one we just set in step 2.1.4.
- _YOUR_FAILOVER_IP_ can be found in your CCP in the _Products_ section or in the SCP in the _Network_ section.
- _YOUR_VSERVER_NAME_ can be found in your SCP in the _General_ section of the corresponding server.
- _YOUR_VSERVER_MAC_ can also be found in your SCP in the _General_ section of the corresponding server (note that you need the MAC of your primary interface not the MAC of the vLAN).

# Step 3 - Set up Keepalived

## Step 3.1 - Install Keepalived

Navigate to either the website [https://keepalived.org/download.html](https://keepalived.org/download.html) or the respective GitHub repository [https://github.com/acassen/keepalived](https://github.com/acassen/keepalived) and install the application. The instructions are available at [https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/blob/master/INSTALL](https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/blob/master/INSTALL).

## Step 3.2 - Turn on packet forwarding

In order for the Keepalived service to forward packets, you need to turn on forwarding in the kernel. Edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and make sure to include the following line using your favorite text editor, e.g. `sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf`:

```
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```

For the changes to take effect execute `sudo sysctl -p`.

## Step 3.3 - Configure Keepalived

I will provide a basic configuration here that is a good starting point for further tweaks if needed. In this configuration, s1 starts as master and s2 starts as backup. If for some reason s1 stops sending adverts / s2 stops receiving adverts, s2 will automatically jump in as failover.

An interesting parameter to start working on is the _advert_int_ parameter. On the one hand, this parameter defines how often an advert should be sent (in this case every 2 seconds) and, on the other hand, that if no advert has been received after 3 \* _advert_int_ seconds, the failover is triggered (so in this case; after 3 \* 2 = 6 seconds).

If a server changes from BACKUP to MASTER state, the _notify_master_ script is triggered, which is our _to_master.sh_ (the one that reroutes our Failover IPv4).

However, there are many more methods besides adverts that you can use to trigger a failover. For example, you could also track files, scripts, processes, interfaces, etc. to increase/decrease priority and trigger the failover based on that. Scripts in particular are very flexible and offer the possibility for more sophisticated checks. If you are interested in more configuration methods, see this [Red Hat Article](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/advanced-keepalived) for some configurations.

**Example _/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf_ for s1**

```
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state MASTER
    interface eth1
    virtual_router_id 101
    priority 255
    advert_int 2
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass CUSTOM_PASSWORD
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        10.132.0.100
    }
    notify_master /PATH/TO/YOUR/SCRIPT/to_master.sh
}
```

**Example _/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf_ for s2**

```
vrrp_instance VI_1 {
    state BACKUP
    interface eth1
    virtual_router_id 101
    priority 254
    advert_int 2
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass CUSTOM_PASSWORD
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        10.132.0.100
    }
    notify_master /PATH/TO/YOUR/SCRIPT/to_master.sh
}
```

Note: The _CUSTOM_PASSWORD_ should be a secure password set by you and must be the same for s1 and s2.

## Step 3.4 - Restart Keepalived

```
sudo systemctl restart keepalived
```

# Conclusion

You should now have a running configuration of Keepalived that automatically triggers a rerouting of your Failover IPv4 to a backup server if the master server is down. You can verify that your system is set up correctly by turning off s1 and observing whether s2 detects the failure situation and reroutes the Failover IPv4.

Some additional remarks:

- If you have any problems with Keepalived, you may want to review your firewall settings and make sure that VRRP (protocol 112) is allowed.
- You can check `sudo tcpdump proto 112 -i eth1` to verify that the servers are receiving each other's adverts.
- There are many Keepalived configuration options to play around with. I highly recommend digging deeper if you need something that is not covered in this tutorial.
- There is always a sweet spot between short downtime in case of a failover and the prevention of false or frequent failovers due to overly strict constraints (flapping).
- It should be noted that the call to the netcup Webservice and the rerouting of the Failover IPv4 may take several seconds.
