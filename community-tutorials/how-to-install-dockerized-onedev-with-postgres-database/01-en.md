# Introduction

In this "how to" tutorial you are going to set up your own OneDev git server with CI/CD and Kanban.
The server will contain a lot of extra features, such as symbol navigation and code search, customizable issue fields and workflow, visual editor for CI/CD pipeline files, service desk for customer support, and code annotation with static analysis results.
And the best part is that it is easy to use, maintain and set up.

First we'll create/edit the docker-compose file, and check all the containers and the setup.

# Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose or docker-compose ([Installation guide](/en/tutorials/how-to-install-the-latest-docker-engine-via-docker-script)) 
- Linux server

# Step 1 - Create a folder to save the docker-compose file and cd into that folder

``` bash
mkdir onedev-with-postgres
```

``` bash
cd onedev-with-postgres
```

# Step 2 - Copy the docker-compose file to your system

``` bash
nano -ET3 docker-compose.yml
```

Paste the content inside this file.

   app:
      hostname: 'onedev'

      restart: unless-stopped
      environment:

         - hibernate_connection_driver_class=org.postgresql.Driver

         - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock'
      networks:
         - 'onedev-network'
      ports:
         # left side is host side - right side is container side and should not be changed
         - '6610:6610'
      depends_on:
         db:
            condition: service_healthy
   db:
      hostname: 'postgresql'
      image: 'postgres:latest'
      container_name: 'onedev-db'
      restart: 'unless-stopped'
      networks:
         - 'onedev-network'
      environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=onedev-user
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeMe.aHighlyComplexPasswordToKeepYouSecure
         - POSTGRES_DB=onedev
      volumes:
         - 'onedev-db-postgresql-vol:/var/lib/postgresql'
         - 'onedev-db-postgresql-data-vol:/var/lib/postgresql/data'
      healthcheck:
         test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready"]
         interval: 1m
         timeout: 5s
         retries: 5

volumes:
   onedev-app-data-vol:
      name: 'onedev-app-data-vol'
   onedev-db-postgresql-vol:
      name: 'onedev-db-postgresql-vol'
   onedev-db-postgresql-data-vol:
      name: 'onedev-db-postgresql-data-vol'

networks:
   onedev-network:
      name: 'onedev-network'

```

# Step 3 - Edit the docker-compose file

Edit the parts with 'changeMe.' and of course any other parts you want to modify, such as the ports exposed on the host machine.

# Step 4 - Check the configuration

Make sure you have changed all the 'changeMe.' parts. Now you are good to go.

# Step 5 - Create the containers

With docker-compose, it's fairly easy to set everything up.

*Type:*

``` bash
docker compose up -d
```

# Step 6 - Check the containers

Deployment should take a maximum of 2 minutes to be up and running as the app waits for the db and a successful health check.

*Type:*

``` bash
docker ps -a
```

You should wait till the onedev-db container is up and healthy and the onedev-app is running.

# Step 7 - Check the URL

Now you can check your port 6610 (or another port if you have changed the left side) with your browser at localhost:6610, or serverIP:6610 if you run it on a server in a different network or your provided URL inside the docker-compose file.

If you cannot reach the URL after a few minutes (3 to 4), you should check your ufw/ufw-docker to expose the ports through the firewall or check your proxy manager, if you use one.

Congratulations, you have created your own onedev server with its own db in just a few minutes.

# Conclusion

As you have seen, setting up OneDev with its own db instance is quite simple and straightforward.
