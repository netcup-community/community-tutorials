# Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to install:

- Nextcloud

I am doing this on a Debian 11 server (RS Zimtstern) but the installations should also work on other Debian versions.

# Requirements

You need Apache2, PHP and MariaDB installed on your server see [here](https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/community-tutorials/install-web-server-mariadb-debian-php/01-en.md)

## Installing Nextcloud

Nextcloud is an open source cloud software. <br>

- Follow Step [1.5](https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/community-tutorials/install-web-server-mariadb-debian-php/01-en.md#step-15-installing-a-configuration-for-the-web-server) and create a new domain or subdomain for the website. <br>
- Switch to the folder you have just created (replace FOLDER with the name of the folder):

```sh
cd /var/www/FOLDER
curl -L -o setup-nextcloud.php https://download.nextcloud.com/server/installer/setup-nextcloud.php
```

- Create a database for the web service [(see Step 1.7)](https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/community-tutorials/install-web-server-mariadb-debian-php/01-en.md#step-17---creating-a-database-optional).<br>
- Open Nextcloud via https://DOMAIN/setup-nextcloud.php and follow the steps shown:<br>
- When you are asked for a database, select MySQL/MariaDB and enter the database login data. <br>

After you installed Nextcloud you should adjust some more settings:

```sh
nano config/config.php
```

... and add after `'installed' => true,`

```
  'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',
  'default_phone_region' => 'DE',
  'htaccess.RewriteBase' => '/',
```

- Change `DE` if you do not live in Germany, look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) for the ISO code of your country. <br/>
- Save your changes by pressing <kbd>CTRL + X</kbd>, then <kbd>y</kbd> and finally by hitting <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. <br/>

```sh
sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:update:htaccess
```

# Conclusion

Now you have completed the installation of Nextcloud. <br>
