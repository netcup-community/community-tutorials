# Introduction

This tutorial describes how to set up Oh My Zsh with some very useful components to pimp up your shell and increase your productivity with many features.
Oh my Zsh is a delightful, open source, community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration. It comes bundled with thousands of helpful functions, helpers, plugins and themes.

# Requirements

- shell
- internet connection

# Step 1 - Install zsh/oh-my-zsh

``` bash
sudo apt install -y zsh
```

**OR**

``` bash
wget "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

# Step 2 - Install zsh-syntax-highlighting

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

# Step 3 - install zsh-autosuggestions

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

# Step 4 - Install autojump

``` bash
sudo apt install -y autojump
```

**OR**

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/wting/autojump.git
```

``` bash
cd autojump
```

``` bash
./install.py
```

# Step 5 - Install nerd (I will install ProFont but you can choose any nerd fornt)

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts.git
```

It's a big repo, time to grab a coffee. :-)

``` bash
cd nerd-fonts
```

``` bash
./install.sh ProFont
```

# Step 6 - Install colorls

``` bash
sudo apt install -y ruby ruby-dev ruby-colorize rbenv
```

``` bash
sudo gem install colorls
```

# Step 7 - Edit config (.zshrc file)

``` bash
vim .zshrc
```

*Edit .zshrc file:*

``` bash
# Enable Powerlevel10k instant prompt. Should stay close to the top of ~/.zshrc.
# Initialization code that may require console input (password prompts, [y/n]
# confirmations, etc.) must go above this block; everything else may go below.
if [[ -r "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh" ]]; then  source "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh"
fi

# If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.
# export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

# Path to your oh-my-zsh installation.
export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"

# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will
# load a random theme each time oh-my-zsh is loaded, in which case,
# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
#ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
#ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"

# Set list of themes to pick from when loading at random
# Setting this variable when ZSH_THEME=random will cause zsh to load
# a t½Cheme from this variable instead of looking in $ZSH/themes/
# If set to an empty array, this variable will have no effect.
# ZSH_THEME_RANDOM_CANDIDATES=( "robbyrussell" "agnoster" )

# Uncomment the following line to use case-sensitive completion.
# CASE_SENSITIVE="true"

# Uncomment the following line to use hyphen-insensitive completion.
# Case-sensitive completion must be off. _ and - will be interchangeable.
# ½CHYPHEN_INSENSITIVE="true"

# Uncomment one of the following lines to change the auto-update behavior
# zs½Ctyle ':omz:update' mode disabled  # disable automatic updates
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode auto      # update automatically without asking
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode reminder  # just remind me to update when it's time

# Uncomment the following line to change how often to auto-update (in days).
# zstyle ':omz:update' frequency 13

# Uncomment the following line if pasting URLs and other text is messed up.
# DISABLE_MAGIC_FUNCTIONS="true"

# Uncomment the following line to disable colors in ls.
# DISABLE_LS_COLORS="true"

# Uncomment the following line to disable auto-setting terminal title.
# DISABLE_AUTO_TITLE="true"

# Uncomment the following line to enable command auto-correction.
# ENABLE_CORRECTION="true"

# Uncomment the following line to display red dots whilst waiting for completion.     
# You can also set it to another string to have that shown instead of the default red dots.
# e.g. COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="%F{yellow}waiting...%f"
# Caution: this setting can cause issues with multiline prompts in zsh < 5.7.1 (see #5765)
# COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="true"

# Uncomment the following line if you want to disable marking untracked files
# under VCS as dirty. This makes repository status check for large repositories       
# much, much faster.
# DISABLE_UNTRACKED_FILES_DIRTY="true"

# Uncomment the following line if you want to change the command execution time       
# stamp shown in the history command output.
# You can set one of the optional three formats:
# "mm/dd/yyyy"|"dd.mm.yyyy"|"yyyy-mm-dd"
# or set a custom format using the strftime function format specifications,
# see 'man strftime' for details.
HIST_STAMPS="yyyy-mm-dd"

# Would you like to use another custom folder than $ZSH/custom?
# ZSH_CUSTOM=/path/to/new-custom-folder

# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in $ZSH/plugins/
# Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
#plugins=(git)
plugins=(
        git
        autojump
        zsh-autosuggestions
        zsh-syntax-highlighting
        zsh-completions
        copyfile
        copypath
        copybuffer
        history
        dirhistory
        sudo
)
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# User configuration

# export MANPATH="/usr/local/man:$MANPATH"

# You may need to manually set your language environment
# export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

# Preferred editor for local and remote sessions
# if [[ -n $SSH_CONNECTION ]]; then
#   export EDITOR='vim'
# else
#   export EDITOR='mvim'
# fi

# Compilation flags
# export ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64"

# Set personal aliases, overriding those provided by oh-my-zsh libs,
# plugins, and themes. Aliases can be placed here, though oh-my-zsh
# users are encouraged to define aliases within the ZSH_CUSTOM folder.
# For a full list of active aliases, run `alias`.
#
# Example aliases
# alias zshconfig="mate ~/.zshrc"
# alias ohmyzsh="mate ~/.oh-my-zsh"
source ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k

# To customize prompt, run `p10k configure` or edit ~/.p10k.zsh.
[[ ! -f ~/.p10k.zsh ]] || source ~/.p10k.zsh

alias cl='ls'
alias ls='colorls'
alias la='colorls -a'
alias ll='colorls -l'
alias lla='colorls -la'
alias con='docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Ports}}"'
```

# Step 8 - Install powerlevel10k

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k
```

``` bash
exec zsh
```

# Step 9 - Configure it to fit your usecase

``` bash
p10k configure
```

ENJOY!!!

# Conclusion

As you can see, installing Oh My Zsh is quite simple, but it can significantly increase your productivity.
