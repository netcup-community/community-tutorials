# Introduction
This tutorial explains how to install NodeJS using the Node Package Manager (NPM).

# Requirements
- Netcup Server, Root or VPS
- Debian operation System (Ubuntu or other Linux distributions should also work)
- curl
- nano OR vim

# Step 1 - Install LTS from Debian repositories (Recommend)
In the first Step we install NodeJS and NPM (Node Package Manager)
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

# Step 1.1 - Install Custom Version from NodeSource
In this example we install the latest LTS version of Node (16), but there is also a list with all available [versions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions)

At first you have to add the NodeSource repository to your system by enter the following command:
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -
```
After that you can install NodeJS with:
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
```

# Step 2 - Check Installation
After the installation is completed, verify it by typing:
```bash
node --version
```
The response should look like:
```bash
v16.8.0
```

and

```bash
npm -v
```
to check the npm version. The response should look like that:
```bash
7.21.0
```

# Step 3 - Setting up a live environment

In this example we are running a web server on a specific port via the npm packege [express](https://expressjs.com/).

Navigate to a folder of your choice and run the following command:
```bash
npm init -y
```
When you run this command, a file called package.json will be created in the selectet folder
```json
{
  "name": "example-folder",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```
then we install express using the following command:
```bash
npm install express --save
```
Now you should also have created a package-lock.json and a node-modules folder.
Last we create an example index.js file and copy the following text into it:

For that you can use a editor of your choice, for example nano or vim.
```bash
nano index.js
```
```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log(`Im running`)
})
```
After saving the file we can run the following command:
```bash
node index.js
```
Now we can open http://[server-ip]:8000 in our browser and we should see the following:

(In your case, replace the [server-ip] with the IP or domain of your server)
```txt
Hello World!
```

# Conclusion
You should now have a fully functional NodeJS installation on which you can run Node applications.
I recommend running your projects in Docker containers so that the pages can be reached at any time.
