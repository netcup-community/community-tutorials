# netcup Community Tutorials
Community contributed tutorials about what can be done with netcup products and services.

## Contribution Guidelines
Please make sure to follow the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to contribute a tutorial.
Once done, open a Pull Request. A Repository Maintainer will review your tutorial and either accept it or get back to you with feedback.

## Rewards
 If your tutorial is accepted, you will receive an E-Mail (sent from our @anexia-it.com addresses) to the address you provide in your GitHub account, asking for your netcup customer-ID in order to process your reward.

1) Rewards are solely granted in the form of netcup vouchers, exclusively for published tutorials.

2) The first 25 tutorials published (authored by 25 different users) will receive €100,- netcup voucher (split into €20,- vouchers) and a netcup hoodie.

    1) If users who already authored one of the first 25 published tutorials will be accepted again, they will receive €60,- netcup vouchers for each additional tutorial published (regardless of the number of tutorials already published).

3) Once 25 tutorials have been published by 25 different users, every following tutorial published will be awarded with €60,- netcup vouchers.
