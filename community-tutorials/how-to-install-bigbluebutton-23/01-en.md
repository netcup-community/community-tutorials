# Introduction

This tutorial explains how to install BigBlueButton 2.3 on your netcup virtual machine. At the end you will have a production-ready installation with [Greenlight](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight) as user frontend (including a valid [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate). Be sure that your server has enough resources, since BigBlueButton needs (according to the [docs](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.3/install.html#minimum-server-requirements)) 8 cores, 16 GB memory and at least 50 GB storage. For a production server and larger or parallel meetings, I recommend a [RS 2000 G9.5](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2894).

# Requirements

- You need a server that is powerful enough to run BigBlueButton (see Introduction). Because we need to install Ubuntu 18.04, you need user credentials to the [netcup server control panel](https://www.servercontrolpanel.de/SCP/Login).
- You need a (sub) domain to run the BigBlueButton with. The (sub) domain must be configured as A record to the IP address of the server. If you don't have a subdomain, just use the hostname provided by netcup (e.g. `v112233445566778899.bestsrv.de`).

# Step 1 - Install Ubuntu 18.04 on your server

At first, we need to install Ubuntu 18.04, since BigBlueButton 2.3 requires Ubuntu 18.04. **WARNING: This will delete all existing data on the server!**

Open the [netcup server control panel](https://www.servercontrolpanel.de/SCP/Login) and log in with the credentials you received by netcup.

Click the server you want to use for BigBlueButton, then click on `Media` on the left side. Click on the link `Images` on in the upper right area of the screen. Now you will see a list of images that you can install on the netcup server:

![server control panel - official images](images/02-servercontrolpanel.png)

Click on `Ubuntu 18.04 LTS`, `Minimal`, `one big partition with os as root partition. Installation may take longer to finish.` and confirm the reinstallation process with your server control panel login password. The installation starts and will take some minutes. When the process is done, you will see the auto-generated root password of the server:

Copy this password and store it in a safe place.

# Step 2 - Pre-installation checks

The image provided by netcup meets all [requirements for the BigBlueButton installation](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.3/install.html#pre-installation-checks). Therefore, there are no special steps to take before running the setup script provided by BigBlueButton.

# Step 3 - Install BigBlueButton

Connect to the server with SSH (e.g. on any Linux system with the following command):

```
ssh root@333.333.333.333
```

If you don't use Linux, you can use any SSH client (e.g. [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)).

When you are connected, run the following command (**be sure, that you replaced the placeholders!**):

- `[HOST]`: Your (sub) domain. If you don't have a custom domain, you can use the hostname provided by netcup, e.g. `v112233445566778899.bestsrv.de`.
- `[MAIL]`: Your email address for the Let's Encrypt account.

```
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v bionic-23 -s [HOST] -e [MAIL] -w -g
```

The parameters used mean the following:

- `-v bionic-23`: Installs the latest version of BigBlueButton 2.3
- `-s [HOST]`: Sets the server's hostname to the given host
- `-e [MAIL]`: Use the given email address for the Let's Encrypt account (you will get notifications when the cert expires)
- `-w`: Installs and configures ufw firewall (opens 22/tcp, 80/tcp and 443/tcp as well as 16384-32768/udp).
- `-g`: Installs [greenlight](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight) (frontend to use with BigBlueButton)

After running this command, the installation process starts. It will take some minutes and finishes with the following lines:

```
# Potential problems described below
.............
```

# Step 4 - Check your installation and create an admin account

Now you can access the installed BigBlueButton. Just open the configured (sub) domain in your webbrowser. You will see the welcome page of BigBlueButton Greenlight.

You can create an admin account by entering the following command:

```
docker exec greenlight-v2 bundle exec rake admin:create
```

You can now log in with the following credentials:

> Email: admin@example.com
>
> Password: administrator

You should immediately change these credentials!
