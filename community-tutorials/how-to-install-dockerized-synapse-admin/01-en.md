# Introduction

In this "how to" tutorial you are going to set up your own Synapse Admin instance.

<here>

First we are going to uninstall any old docker engine and install the latest (can be skipped), then we'll create/edit the docker-compose file, and check all the containers and the setup.

# Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose or docker-compose
- Linux server
- Access to the following endpoints: /_matrix AND /_synapse/admin

# Step 1 - Uninstall old Docker Engine, CLI, containerd, and Docker Compose packages

``` bash
sudo apt-get purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin docker-ce-rootless-extras
```

# Step 2 - Curl the script for installation from docker

``` bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
```

# Step 3 - Dry run the script to check for complications

``` bash
sudo sh ./get-docker.sh --dry-run
```

# Step 4 - Run the script

``` bash
sudo sh ./get-docker.sh
```

# Step 5 - Verify the installation

``` bash
docker --version
```

# Step 6 - Create a folder to save the docker-compose file and cd into that folder

``` bash
mkdir synapse-admin
```

``` bash
cd synapse-admin
```

# Step 7 - Copy the docker-compose file to your system

``` bash
vim docker-compose.yml
```

Paste the content inside this file.

``` yml

version: '3.8'

services:
   app:
      hostname: 'synapse-admin'
      image: 'awesometechnologies/synapse-admin:0.8.7'
      container_name: 'synapse-admin-app'
      restart: 'unless-stopped'
      build:
         context: https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin.git
         args:
            # Optionally define your matrix url
            - REACT_APP_SERVER=https://changeMe.example.com 
      networks: 
         # Change to your matrix network
         - 'matrix-network'
      ports:
         # left side is host side - right side is container side and should not be changed
         - '80:80'

networks:
   # Change to your matrix network
   matrix-network:
      external: true
      name: 'matrix-network'

```

# Step 8 - Edit the docker-compose file

Edit the parts with 'changeMe.' and of course networks and any other parts you want to modify, such as the ports exposed on the host machine.

# Step 9 - Check the configuration

Make sure that you have changed all the 'changeMe.' parts. Now you are good to go.

# Step 10 - Create the containers

With docker-compose, it's fairly easy to set everything up.

*Type:*

``` bash
docker compose up -d
```

# Step 11 - Check the containers

Deployment should take a maximum of 2 minutes to be up and running.

*Type:*

``` bash
docker ps -a
```

# Step 12 - Check the URL

Now you can check your port 80 (or another port if you have changed the left side) with your browser at localhost:80, or serverIP:80 if you run it on a server in a different network or your provided URL inside the docker compose-file.

If you cannot reach the URL after few minutes (1 to 2), you should check your ufw/ufw-docker to expose the ports through the firewall or check your proxy manager if you use one.

Congratulations, you have created your own synapse-admin in just a few minutes.

# Conclusion

As you have seen, setting up synapse-admin is quite simple and straightforward.
