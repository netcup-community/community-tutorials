# Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to set up a Telegram bot using the Telegram API. This will allow you to receive a message on Telegram after each login attempt on your server.

I am doing this on a Debian installation, but this process should also work on other Linux distributions.


## Requirements

You need a running vServer or Root Server from netcup with superuser access.

## Step 1 - Installing Telegram
First, install Telegram on your smartphone and open the app.

## Step 2  Creating the bot
Then search for the user "botfather" in the contacts.
We create a new bot by sending "botfather" the following message:

`/newbot`

"botfather" will ask for the name of the bot. You can choose any name you want, but note that the name must be unique. Next, choose a username. This must end with the suffix "_bot". 

For example, I used these names:

`Superduperbot for the bot
Superduperbot_bot for the username`

"botfather" will now create the bot and generate a token. We will need this later, so write down the token.

Here is an example of how the token looks:

`123456090:ABCDEFGHIJK-ABCDEFGHIJK`

## Step 3 Configuring the bot

Now, search for the newly created bot in your Telegram contacts. Next, start the bot by clicking on start or sending the message:

`/start`

Next, we point our Browser to the address shown below. Replace "TOKEN" with the token you got from "botfather" in the previous step:


`https://api.telegram.org/bot"TOKEN"/getUpdates`
     
Write down the row of numbers coming after "id". This is our "Telegram_id" and will be needed in the next step.

     
## Step 4 Creating the notification script

Head over to your netcup server and create a script under "/etc/profile.d" named something like "telegram_message_on_login.sh" by running the command shown below. Note that any script in "/etc/profile.d" will be executed during each login to your server.

`nano /etc/profile.d/telegram_message_on_login.sh`

Copy the following into the terminal window. Please replace the values under TOKEN and ID with your specific data:

`#!/bin/bash

    TOKEN="123456090:ABCDEFGHIJK-ABCDEFGHIJK"
    ID="123456789"
    HOSTNAME=$(hostname -f)
    DATE="$(date +"%d.%b.%Y--%H:%M")"
    MESSAGE=" $USER logged in at  $DATE on $HOSTNAME !"
    URL="https://api.telegram.org/bot$TOKEN/sendMessage"

    curl -s -X POST $URL -d chat_id=$ID -d text="$MESSAGE" >/dev/null`

Last, make the script executable by running this command:

`chmod +x /etc/profile.d/telegram_message_on_login.sh`

# Conclusion
From now on you will receive a message via Telegram everytime someone logs into your server.
