# Introduction

This tutorial explains how to install KeyHelp on a netcup `VPS 1000 G9`.

# Requirements

You need an empty VPS with root access and Debian or Ubuntu OS installed. I have had installations with only 1GB RAM that worked fine, but I recommend a minimum of 4GB RAM and two cores, just like a `VPS 500 G8`.
You also need a domain that points to your VPS and that you will use for the Control Panel. In this tutorial, `example.com` is used as an example domain.

# Step 1 - Dependencies

First, update your package manager.

```
apt update
```

Please install the `wget` and `ca-certificates` packages so that no error occurs during the installation.

```
apt install wget ca-certificates -y
```

# Step 2 - Install KeyHelp

You can install KeyHelp by simply pasting this line:

```
wget https://install.keyhelp.de/get_keyhelp.php -O install_keyhelp.sh ; bash install_keyhelp.sh ;
```

and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

The installer will be downloaded and executes itself automatically.

At this point, PHP, KeyHelp and IonCube will be installed.

## Step 2.1 - Language

Now, you will be prompted to choose a language. If you want to keep the installation in English, simply continue by entering `N` and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You can exit the installer anytime by hitting `Q`.

If you want to continue in another language, enter `L` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

You can choose what language you want, type in the country code next to your language in brackets and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Continue by entering `N` and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

## Step 2.2 - Host settings

You can now customize the installation parameters. I want to change the hostname, so I enter `1` for and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Then I enter the hostname `example.com` and confirm it by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. I now repeat this for the other settings.

When you are done, type `S` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to start the installation.

If the installation is complete, the server will reboot itself.

# Step 3 - Your first login

![Login](./images/login.png)
Now when you visit your domain `https://example.com`you will see the KeyHelp login. Enter your username and password that you defined in step 2.2 and press "Login".

The panel should look like this:

# Step 4 - Going further

You can now create users, domains, mailboxes and databases with KeyHelp. Maybe someone will continue this tutorial. In the meantime, you can look at the documentation https://doc.keyhelp.de/switch/?lang=en and continue.

# Conclusion

You now have a fully intact KeyHelp installation on your VPS to host websites and even resell your system power to others.
