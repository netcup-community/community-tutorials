# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will set up an nginx reverse proxy using Docker and
docker-compose. This will allow us to route HTTP requests arriving through different
subdomains to web services running in different Docker containers. We will also
set up a LetsEncrypt CertBot to automatically create and renew TLS certificates.

# Requirements

- Server (root or VPS)
- Working Docker installation
- Working docker-compose installation.

## Step 1 - Define the services using docker-compose

Create a new YAML file `reverse-proxy.yml` and open it using an editor of your
choice:

```
vim reverse-proxy.yml
```

Insert the following:

```yml
version: '3'

services:
    nginx:
        image: jwilder/nginx-proxy
        container_name: nginx-proxy
        restart: always
        logging:
            driver: "json-file"
            options:
                max-size: "50m"
                max-file: "1"
        ports:
            - '80:80'
            - '443:443'
        volumes:
            - conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d
            - certs:/etc/nginx/certs
            - vhost:/etc/nginx/vohost.d
            - html:/usr/share/nginx/html
            - dhparam:/etc/nginx/dhparam
            - '/var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro'

    nginx-proxy-le:
        image: jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion
        container_name: nginx-proxy-le
        restart: always
        logging:
            driver: "json-file"
            options:
                max-size: "50m"
                max-file: "1"
        volumes:
            - conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d
            - certs:/etc/nginx/certs:rw
            - vhost:/etc/nginx/vhost.d
            - html:/usr/share/nginx/html
            - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro'
        environment:
            NGINX_PROXY_CONTAINER: nginx-proxy

networks:
    default:
        external:
            name: compose-net

volumes:
    conf:
    vhost:
    html:
    certs:
    dhparam:
```

This docker-compose file will create two services: The `nginx-proxy` container
will run the nginx reverse proxy, while `nginx-proxy-le` will manage LetsEncrypt's TLS
certificates. Please note that the log files have a size limit to avoid running out of disk space.
You can of course change this. The nginx config can be found in the
`conf` Docker volume (though it should not be necessary to edit it manually).

## Step 2 - Create the Docker network

Run the following Docker command:

```
docker network create compose-net
```

If you are currently not the `root` user and did not set up your user to
use Docker, you may have to run this command with `sudo` privileges.

## Step 3 - Deploy the services

Use docker-compose to deploy both containers and auto-create the Docker network
and volumes:

```
docker-compose -f reverse-proxy.yml up -d
```

Just as in Step 2, you might need `sudo` privileges depending on your system
setup.

## Step 4 - Set up your web services

You can now set up your web services to be reachable under a given subdomain.
Just define the subdomain you want to route to a service using the `VIRTUAL_HOST`
environment variable. If you use a different docker-compose file for your
services, make sure to use the same Docker network as for the reverse proxy:

```yml
# my-service.yml
version: '3'
services:
    whoami:
        image: jwilder/whoami
        environment:
          - VIRTUAL_HOST=whoami.your-domain.de

networks:
    default:
        external:
            name: compose-net
```

Make sure that your subdomain resolves to your server's public IP address, then
deploy your web service:

```
docker-compose -f my-service.yml up -d
```

The LetsEncrypt companion container should now automatically request a TLS
certificate and set up the reverse proxy in order to route requests to your service
afterwards. Give it a few minutes (as key generation might take a while), then
try reaching your service at `whoami.your-domain.de` (or whatever subdomain you
used) from your web browser.

# Conclusion

This fully automated setup makes it easy to deploy multiple web services without
having to use multiple IP addresses. It also handles TLS certificates for you,
making it easy to make services publicly available.
