# Introduction
In this tutorial you will learn how to set up an MLflow server for experiment tracking. Such a server is crucial for meaningful AI development and data science, as minor parameter changes can have a huge impact on performance.
Having a central instance for storing such information is also beneficial with regard to collaboration.
Additionally, MLflow also provides a basic visualization of the tracked information so that models can be easily compared.

Unfortunately, MLflow does not provide any authentication feature. So this tutorial also covers setting up http basic authentication with nginx and accessing the MLflow instance from a Python script.

# Requirements
A tracking server, unlike training instances, does not require many resources.
Therefore, a simple VPS, e.g. [VPS 200 G10s](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2948) should be enough for the moment.
In the long run, more hard drive space may be required.
The main requirement for this tutorial is a Linux server with a user with `sudo` rights.

# Step 1 - Ordering the VPS
For this tutorial, we are using the [VPS 200 G10s](https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2948), but any VPS or root server should be usable.
After getting access to the serer, I provisioned it with the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS minimal image provided in the SCP. In addition, I enabled a custom user named `amjad` and "shh key only" login for this specific user during the setup (see screenshot below).

![images/provision_with_ssh_key.jpg]

# Step 2 - Install system dependencies
After provisioning, the server should be ready for login with the provided user (`amjad` in this tutorial).
First of all we should run updates:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

After all updates are done, some applications need to be installed:
* `python3`: MLflow is mainly written in Python.
* `pip`: Python package manager
* `python3.10-venv`: for creating virtual environments
* `gcc`: compiler, which will be needed later for some Python packages
* `postgressql`: MLflow provides different backends for storing the information. By default a .yaml file is used, but an SQL database is better in terms of read and write performance as the database grows.
* nginx: as reverse proxy to provide authentication

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3.10-venv postgresql nginx gcc
```

Typically, Postgres and nginx services start automatically.

# Step 3 - Prepare database
Next we need to set up the database. This is done by the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo -u postgres psql
could not change directory to "/home/amjad": Permission denied
psql (14.7 (Ubuntu 14.7-0ubuntu0.22.04.1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# create database MLflow;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# create user MLflow with encrypted password 'airocks';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# grant all privileges on database MLflow to MLflow;
GRANT
```

Here the password is `airocks`, please use a more secure one when setting up your server.

# Step 4 - Install MLflow itself
In this step we will install MLflow itself.
We are going to install it in a virtual environment to avoid interference with other applications:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv MLflow_venv
$ source MLflow_venv/bin/activate
(MLflow_venv) $ pip install MLflow psycopg2-binary
```

This will install a whole bunch of dependencies for MLflow. 
The `psycopg2-binary` package is required for the connection to the Postgres database.
To check whether the installation was successful, you can run the following command:

```bash
(MLflow_venv) $ MLflow --version MLflow, version 2.2.2
```

Please bear in mind that you have to activate the virtual environment before running any `MLflow` command.

Next we take care about the directories for log files and artifacts since they are not stored in the database:

```bash
(MLflow_venv) $ mkdir -p ~/MLflow/mlruns # artifact dir
(MLflow_venv) $ mkdir -p ~/MLflow/mllogs # logs dir
```

To test runability, we will start the MLflow server in a "free-to-all" manner on port 8000:

```bash
(MLflow_venv) $ MLflow server --backend-store-uri postgresql://MLflow:airocks@localhost/MLflow --artifacts-destination ~/MLflow/mlruns --serve-artifacts -h 0.0.0.0 -p 8000

```

Now you should be able to see the webui in a browser by typing the IP address or the proper domain name in the address line and appending an `:8000` for the port.

![images/first_impression_webui.jpg]

You will probably see almost nothing, but this will change later when we run a few experiments and track them to this instance.
For now please kill the process with `ctrl+c` to avoid security issues.
Also, MLflow is currently not started automatically when the server is restarted.

# Step 5 - Setup MLflow as service

Now we are going to tell `systemd` to take care about the MLflow server.
Therefore, an `MLflow.service` file needs to be created at `/etc/systemd/system` and filled with the following input:

```
[Unit]
Description=MLflow Server
After=network.target                                    
[Service]
Restart=on-failure                                      RestartSec=30                                           StandardOutput=file:/home/amjad/MLflow/mllogs/stdout.logStandardError=file:/home/amjad/MLflow/mllogs/stderr.log User=root                                               ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'PATH=/home/amjad/MLflow_venv/bin:$PATH exec MLflow server --backend-store-uri postgresql://MLflow:airocks@localhost/MLflow --artifacts-destination ~/MLflow/mlruns --serve-artifacts -h 127.0.0.1 -p 8000'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

In this file, the virtual environment is "encoded" in the `PATH` variable. Please note that the host flag (`-h` flag in the cli) is changed here to `127.0.0.1`, so MLflow cannot be accessed directly.
We are going to use `nginx` to face the outer web and to take care about authentication.

Now the `MLflow` service needs to be enabled:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable MLflow Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/MLflow.service → /etc/systemd/system/MLflow.service.
$ sudo systemctl start MLflow ```

# Step 6 - Set up nginx with http basic authentication
In this step, we are going to use nginx to pass the requests to MLflow.
In file `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` you just need to change the line

```
try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
```

by

```
proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
```

Next we want to introduce http basic authentication, but first of all we need to install `apache2-utils`:

```
$ sudo apt-get install -y apache2-utils
```

This package is needed to generate a proper password hash.
Now we create a new user called `amjad`:

```
$ sudo htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/.htpasswd amjad
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user amjad
```

You need to type in your password twice. I used `airules`, please use a better one for your server.
Next we need to head back to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` and add the following lines right after the `proxy_pass` statement you introduced before:

```
auth_basic "MLflow Access";                             auth_basic_user_file /etc/apache2/.htpasswd;
```
Now you have to restart nginx:

```
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
```

With this you have secured your MLflow instance, at least a little bit. To be really safe, you need to enforce TLS, but that's a topic for another tutorial.

# Step 7 - Track your first experiment
Your MLflow instance is ready for use, but how to use it? This is the final step, which shows you how to track your experiments.
First of all, you need to make sure that you've also got `python3` and `pip` installed on your local machine:

```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.11.2
$ pip --version
pip 23.0.1 from /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pip (python 3.11)
```

Then create a virtual environment locally and install `MLflow` and `scikit-learn`:

```
$ python3 -m venv ai_playground
$ source ai_playground/bin/activate
(ai_playground) ~ $ pip install MLflow scikit-learn
```

We are going to utilize `scikit-learn` to train a [random forest classifiers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) of different sizes (i.e. numbers of trees) on the [iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#iris-dataset) (a toy example for classification of flowers) to compare their accuracy with each other.
We create an experiment called `RF Tree Numbers`, iterate over sizes from 1 to 20 trees, and log the numbers of trees and the accuracy of the random forest in a so called run (a substructure of an MLflow experiment).
Finally, the trained random forest will be saved along with the parameter and accuracy, so you can download the model afterwards.

We are going to use the following script to do our first experiment (it is well commented):

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import MLflow  MLflow.set_tracking_uri('http://amjad:airules@46.38.237.20') # Do tracking on our fresh remote server

# Download and load data
data = load_iris()

X = data['data']
y = data['target']

# Split data into training and teat set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Avoid randomness in split
exp_name = 'RF Tree Numbers'
# Ecaluate random forests with different number of trees
experiment = MLflow.get_experiment_by_name(exp_name)
if experiment is None:
    experiment_id = MLflow.create_experiment(exp_name)
else:
    experiment_id = experiment.experiment_id

for n_est in range(1, 21): # Check forests from 1 to 20 trees     MLflow.start_run(experiment_id=experiment_id)
    rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_est)
    rf.fit(X_train, y_train) # Training
    accuracy = rf.score(X_test, y_test) # Evaluation
    # Keep track with MLflow logging     MLflow.log_param('n_est', n_est)     MLflow.log_metric('accuracy', accuracy)     MLflow.sklearn.log_model(rf, artifact_path="sklearn-model") # Upload trained model as artifact     MLflow.end_run()
```

A detailed explanation of how random forests work is out of scope of this tutorial. In short words: a random forest is a bunch of decision trees.
Each tree decides on its own which class a sample belongs to.
In the end there is a vote and the class voted the most will be chosen as result. More details can be read [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest).

I saved the script under `example.py` and executed it by calling `python example.py` within my local virtual environment.

After the script has finished running, the webui looks a bit different:

![images/webui_with_experiment.jpg]

Each run of an experiment is listed in the webui and can be explored by clicking on the experiments. You can check how many trees have been trained (`n_est` parameter) and how high the accuracy is.
Additionally, you can also download the trained models and do comparisons.

# Conclusion
After following the description in this tutorial, you have set up a central MLflow instance to track your AI experiments for sustainable and reproducible data science.
Additionally, you have tracked your first machine learning experiments.

Further steps would be to secure the access via TLS and improve scalability in the long run.
