# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to install Prometheus and Grafana to collect data from your servers using Node Exporter.  
Prometheus Node Exporter provides hardware and OS metrics of the host system.  
Prometheus is the database where all the metrics are stored. It is also the software that collects the metrics provided by the exporters over HTTP.  
Grafana visualizes the collected data. It is basically the frontend for the Prometheus database, but supports many other databases as well.

# Requirements

- Minimum of 2 Debian-based servers with root / sudo access (Ubuntu works too)

# Step 1 - Install Node Exporter on all servers

Node Exporter collects the system data and provides it in a format that Prometheus can read. This exporter should be installed on all hosts. There are two ways to install the Node Exporter:

1. Through the package manager:

With this method, you will most likely not install the latest available version of Node Exporter, but this should be sufficient for most setups.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y prometheus-node-exporter
```

2. Through binary download (newest version):

With this method, you can install any version you want, including the latest version with the latest features and bugfixes.  
All available versions can be found on the release page: https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases

```console
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.2.2/node_exporter-1.2.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xf node_exporter-1.2.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd node_exporter-1.2.2.linux-amd64
./node_exporter &
```

# Step 2 - Set up Prometheus on the "metrics" server

Prometheus pulls the metrics from the Node Exporter and stores the data in its database.

```
sudo apt-get install -y prometheus
```

Check if Prometheus was installed successfully by opening the server IP followed by port 9090 in your browser:

![prometheus](images/prometheus.png)

Now the Node Exporter targets must be configured in the Prometheus server. The configuration is stored in `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.
Add the following "job_name" to your "scrape_configs" and replace "ip-of-other-server" with the IP address of your second server:

```yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "node_exporter"
    metrics_path: "/metrics"
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - "localhost:9100"
          - "ip-of-other-server:9100"
```

If you have more servers, just add them to the "Targets" list one by one.
To apply the configuration changes, the Prometheus service must be restarted.

```
sudo systemctl restart prometheus.service
```

Use systemctl to check the status of the service.

```
sudo systemctl status prometheus.service
```

Prometheus now automatically scrapes Node Exporter endpoints periodically on all configured targets and stores the metrics in its database.

# Step 3 - Install Grafana on the "metrics" server

Grafana is used to visualize the metrics collected and stored by the Prometheus service.

First you need to add the external Grafana apt repository:

```
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common wget
wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
```

Then you can install Grafana itself:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y grafana
```

Use systemctl to check the status of the service.

```
sudo systemctl status grafana-server.service
```

# Step 4 - Configure Prometheus as data source in Grafana

Grafana can easily be configured through a web interface. It is reachable on port 3000 with the following default credentials:

Username: admin  
Password: admin

After the first login you are forced to change the password. Make sure to pick a strong password.

To configure Prometheus as a metrics data source, click on the settings on the left side and select "Data sources":

![Grafana data sources](images/grafana-datasource-1.png)

Then select "Prometheus" as "Time series databases":

![Grafana data sources](images/grafana-datasource-2.png)

Now you can enter "http://localhost:9090" as URL and save the data source.

# Step 5 - Add a dashboard in Grafana

The community publishes a lot of dashboards on grafana.com: https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/?search=node+exporter&dataSource=prometheus

For example, pick the [Node Exporter Full](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/1860) dashboard and copy the ID on the left side.
To import the dashboard, switch back to your Grafana installation and select "Import" after hovering on the "+" on the left side:

![Grafana import](images/grafana-import-1.png)

Paste the ID you just copied, click the "Load" button and then finally import your dashboard.

After the successful import, the dashboards display the metrics stored in your Prometheus database.

# Conclusion

By following the instructions in this tutorial, you have installed the Prometheus Node Exporter on two servers that provide metrics collected by the Prometheus installation.
Grafana visualizes the data collected from your two servers. If you need more data from different applications, you can expand this setup in the future with new exporters and dashboards.
