# Introduction

This tutorial explains how to install and configure Fail2Ban on a Debian Linux system. If too many SSH login failures are registered for an IP address, Fail2Ban will block this IP address for a specified blocking time.

# Requirements

You need the APT Package Manager and an editor, for example vi or nano, to create and change config files.

# Step 1 - Install Fail2Ban with the APT Package Manager

All commands are executed with sudo because root permissions are required.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fail2ban
```

# Step 2 - Copy the default config file to a new location

Fail2Ban has two configuration files: `/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf` and `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/defaults-debian.conf`.
You should not update these files because they may be overwritten when the package is updated.
The recommended way is to create a `.local` file, which overrides the settings of the `.conf` file:

```
sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

# Step 3 - Change the [DEFAULT] section and add configuration

Open the configuration file `jail.local` with a text editor of your choice:

```
vi /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Change the section [DEFAULT] to this configuration:

```
[DEFAULT]
# "ignoreip" can be a list of IP addresses, CIDR masks or DNS hosts. Fail2Ban
# will not ban a host that matches an address in this list. Several addresses
# can be defined using space (and/or comma) separator.
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1
# "bantime" is the number of seconds that a host is banned.
bantime  = 3600
# A host is banned if it has generated "maxretry" during the last "findtime"
# seconds.
findtime = 600
# "maxretry" is the number of failures before a host gets banned.
maxretry = 5
```

Save the configuration file.

# Step 4 - Enable SSHD in the [sshd] section of the configuration file

Open the configuration file with a text editor:

```
vi /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Search for the [sshd] section:

```
#
# SSH servers
#

[sshd]
```

Add 'enabled' after the [sshd]:

```
#
# SSH servers
#

[sshd]
enabled = true
```

With this configuration we enable SSHD for Fail2Ban to watch the log path for authentication errors.
Save the configuration file.

# Step 5 - Optional: Configure email notifications

You can optionally configure email notifications in the file `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`.
To do so, you have to change the [DEFAULT]-section:

```
[DEFAULT]
# ...
action = %(action_mw)s
destemail = admin@your-special-netcup-domain.net
sender = root@your-special-netcup-domain.net
```

# Step 6 - Restart the Fail2Ban service

`sudo service fail2ban restart`

# Step 7 - Check the status of the Fail2Ban service

`sudo service fail2ban status`

The logs should look like this:

```
Nov 06 23:13:44 v22039013573286090 systemd[1]: Starting Fail2Ban Service...
Nov 06 23:13:44 v22039013573286090 systemd[1]: Started Fail2Ban Service.
Nov 06 23:13:44 v22039013573286090 fail2ban-server[2352904]: Server ready
```

# Conclusion

By reading this tutorial you learned how to install and configure Fail2Ban. Fail2Ban supports not only SSHD, but also databases, mail servers and webservers.
