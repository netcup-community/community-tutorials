# Introduction

This tutorial describes how to install Baikal on ANY Webhosting package.

# Requirements

The smallest Webhosting package is sufficient for this tutorial but you can also use any other Webhosting package.

# Step 1 - Installing Baikal

1. Log in to the Customer Control Panel (CCP) at https://customercontrolpanel.de/
2. Open the right webserver (Products -> Magnifying glass next to the webserver)
3. Click on "Plesk Overview"
4. Click on the "Files"-Tab in the menu on the left
5. Download the latest version of Baikal from [https://github.com/sabre-io/Baikal/releases](https://github.com/sabre-io/Baikal/releases) (e.g. `baikal-0.9.3.zip`)
6. Drag and drop the downloaded file into the Plesk file manager
7. Click on the uploaded file and confirm the extraction by clicking on "OK" (It may be on the bottom of the page)
8. On the right end of the line of the extracted folder, click on the three dots and then on "Rename"
9. Rename the folder to a domain you will use later (e.g. `baikal.example.com`)
10. Click on the folder name

# Step 2 - Creating a Subdomain

1. Click on the "Website & Domains"-Tab in the menu on the left
2. Click on "Add Subdomain"
3. Enter a name for the subdomain (e.g. baikal) - The one you used in step 1.9
4. Choose a domain (e.g. `example.com`) - Also the one you used in step 1.9
5. Enter a document root and append `/html` (e.g. `baikal.example.com/html`)
6. Click on "OK"

# Step 3 - SSL Certificate

1. Click on "SSL/TLS Certificates"
2. Click on "Add SSL/TLS Certificate"
3. Click the left-most "Install"-Button
4. Enter your email address
5. Check the last checkbox (This will not only secure the subdomain but also www.[subdomain])
6. Click on "Get it free"
7. Check the slider saying "Redirect from http to https"
8. Check the slider saying "OCSP Stapling"

# Step 4 - Configuring Baikal

1. Open the subdomain you created earlier (e.g. `https://baikal.example.com`)
2. Select the Time Zone you want to use (e.g. `Europe/Berlin`)
3. Choose if you want to enable CardDAV, CalDAV or both (Normally you want to enable both)
4. Set an admin password
5. Click on "Save changes"
6. Click on "Start using Baikal"
7. Login with the admin password you set earlier

# Step 5 - Creating a user

1. Click on "Users and resources" in the navigation bar
2. Click on "Add user"
3. Enter a username (e.g. `john.doe`)
4. Enter a display name (e.g. `John Doe`)
5. Enter a EMail address (e.g. `johndoe@example.com`)
6. Enter a password (twice)
7. Click on "Save changes"
8. Click on the Information icon next to the user you just created
9. Copy the URI

# Step 6 - Setting up your device

Because devices are different, I can't give you a step-by-step guide for every device. But I can give you the information you need to set up your device.  
Here i will link you documents for the most common devices:
