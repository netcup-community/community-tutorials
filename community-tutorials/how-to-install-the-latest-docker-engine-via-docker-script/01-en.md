# Introduction

This tutorial describes how to install the latest Docker Engine on your server.

# Requirements

- Linux based server

# Step 1 - Uninstall old Docker Engine, CLI, containerd, and Docker Compose packages

``` bash
sudo apt-get purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin docker-ce-rootless-extras
```

``` bash
sudo apt-get update
```

# Step 2 - Curl the script for installation from docker

``` bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
```

# Step 3 - Dry run the script to check for complications

``` bash
sudo sh ./get-docker.sh --dry-run
```

# Step 4 - Finally run the script

``` bash
sudo sh ./get-docker.sh
```

# Step 4 - Verify the installation

``` bash
docker --version
```

# Conclusion

As you have seen installing the latest Docker Engine is quite simple with the Docker Script provided by Docker directly.
