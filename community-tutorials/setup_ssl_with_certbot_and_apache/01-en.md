# Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up SSL/TLS certificates with the help of Certbot on an Apache web server running on Ubuntu. SSL certificates are essential for securing communication between your server and clients, protecting sensitive data from eavesdropping and ensuring a safe browsing experience for your users.

We will use Certbot, a free and open-source tool, to obtain and automatically renew SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt, a certificate authority that provides trusted SSL certificates at no cost.

The tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of the Ubuntu command line and have already set up an Apache web server. If you haven't installed Apache yet, you can do so using `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2
```

# Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following:

* A server running Ubuntu (tested on Ubuntu 20.04).
* Apache web server installed and running.
* A registered domain name pointing to your server's IP address. Make sure your domain's DNS records are properly configured.

# Step 1 - Installing Certbot
Certbot is available in the default Ubuntu repositories, making installation straightforward. Open a terminal and run the following commands to install Certbot:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
```

# Step 2 - Configuring Apache for SSL
Before obtaining SSL certificates, we need to configure Apache to use SSL. The Certbot tool can automatically configure Apache for us. Run the following command and follow the prompts:
```bash
sudo certbot --apache
```

Certbot will ask for your email address for urgent renewal and security notices. After providing it, Certbot will detect the domains configured in your Apache virtual hosts and ask you to choose which domains you want to enable SSL for. Select the appropriate domains, and Certbot will configure Apache accordingly.

# Step 3 - Verifying SSL Configuration
Once the SSL configuration is complete, Certbot will reload Apache to apply the changes. It will also create a cron job to automatically renew the certificates before they expire.

To verify the SSL configuration, open a web browser and enter your domain with https:// (e.g., https://yourdomain.com). If everything is set up correctly, you should see a padlock icon in the browser's address bar, indicating that the connection is secure.

# Step 4 - Checking Certificate Renewal
Certbot certificates are typically valid for 90 days and will need to be renewed periodically. The cron job created by Certbot takes care of automatic renewal. However, it's a good idea to test the renewal process manually to ensure it works as expected.

To test the renewal, run the following command:
```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

# Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully set up SSL/TLS certificates on your Apache web server using Certbot. Your website is now secured with encrypted communication, and users can browse it safely.

Remember to periodically check for certificate expiration and ensure that automatic renewal is working correctly to maintain a secure website.
