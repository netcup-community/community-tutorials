# Introduction

This tutorial describes how to install Wirow on Ubuntu 22.04.

The time needed to follow this tutorial is approximately 10 - 20 minutes.

The tutorial was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 (July 2023).

The tutorial uses the example IP `123.123.123.123`.  
This hostname needs to be replaced by the name of your own server when you perform the workflow described in this tutorial.  
We will also use the subdomain `conference.example.com`, please replace it with your own domain.

# Requirements

A VPS 200 is sufficient for this tutorial.

The server must already have the Ubuntu 22.04 Image from the (SCP)[https://servercontrolpanel.de/] installed.

# Step 1 - Finding out the IP of your server

1. Log in to the SCP (Server Control Panel) under https://www.servercontrolpanel.de
2. Click on the server you would like to use.
3. You are now in the "General" tab and, below on the right, you will see a pane labelled "Network".
4. Here you can find the IP of your server (under IPv4).
5. Write it down somewhere.

# Step 2 - Configuring DNS

1. Log in to the CCP (Customer Control Panel) under https://www.customercontrolpanel.de
2. In the sidebar on the left, click on "Domains".
3. Find the domain you want to use and click on the "Magnifying glass" symbol next to it.
4. In the new window, click on "DNS".
5. Scroll down until there are empty fields.
6. In the first field, write your subdomain name (I recommend using "conference" or something similar).
7. In the dropdown menu, select `A`.
8. In the last field, write the IP of your server (from Step 1).
9. Click on "Save DNS records" at the bottom of the form.

# Step 3 - Preparing the server

First you need to log in to your server via SSH. Then proceed as follows:

1. Enter `sudo -s` to get root privileges.
2. If asked for your password, enter it and press `Enter`.
3. Now enter `apt update -y && apt upgrade -y  && apt remove -y nginx apache2 lighttpd && apt autoremove -y && apt install -y wget unzip zip` to update the server, remove any existing webservers and old packages and install required packages.

- If a pink window with the title "Pending kernel upgrade" is displayed, press `Enter` once to continue.
- If a pink window with the title "Daemons using outdated libraries" is displayed, press `Enter` once to continue.

4. Enter `exit` to exit the root shell.

# Step 4 - Getting the Wirow files

1. Go to (wirow.io)[wirow.io] and click on "EAP" in the menu bar.
2. Now you have to enter your email address and name. Then click on "Request Access" (you can enter "None" in the "Company" field).
3. You will receive an email with a link to the download page.
4. Copy the link.

# Step 5 - Starting Wirow

1. After entering `wget`, paste the link you copied in Step 4, and then press `Enter`.
2. Enter `unzip wirow.zip` to unzip the downloaded file.
3. Enter `sudo /usr/sbin/setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' ./wirow` to allow Wirow to use port 80 and 443 (you will be asked for the root user password).
4. Enter `./wirow -n conference.example.com -a PASSWORD` to start Wirow (replace `conference.example.com` with your subdomain and `PASSWORD` with a password of your choice).
5. Navigate to your domain in your browser. Enter the password you assigned in Step 5.3 with the username "admin" to log in to Wirow.
6. Click on the big "Admin" button in the center.
7. Click on the "Users" icon in the top right corner.
8. Click on the "Edit" button next to the user "admin".
9. Enter a new password and click on "Save" (you can also change the username here or add an email address.
10. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop Wirow in the terminal.

# Step 6 - Setting up Wirow to start on boot

We want to start Wirow automatically when the server starts.

1. Enter `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/wirow.service` to create a new systemd service file.
2. Paste the following code into the file:

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Wirow - A free and open source web based video conferencing tool
Documentation=https://github.com/wirow-io/wirow-server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=[REPLACE_WITH_USERNAME]
WorkingDirectory=/home/[REPLACE_WITH_USERNAME]/
ExecStart=/home/[REPLACE_WITH_USERNAME]/wirow -n conference.example.com
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Replace `[REPLACE_WITH_USERNAME]` with the user under which you extracted the Wirow files in Step 5.2.
4. Replace `conference.example.com` with your domain.
5. Exit the file by pressing `Ctrl + X` and then `Y` and then `Enter`.
6. Enter `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` to reload the systemd daemon.
7. Enter `sudo systemctl enable wirow` to enable the service.
8. Enter `sudo systemctl start wirow` to start the service.

# Step 7 - Setting up the firewall

We need a firewall to protect our server from unwanted connections.

We will use `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) to set up the firewall, because it is easy to use and configure and is also pre-installed on Ubuntu.

1. Enter `ufw allow ssh` to allow SSH connections.
2. Enter `ufw allow http` to allow HTTP connections.
3. Enter `ufw allow https` to allow HTTPS connections.
4. Enter `ufw enable` to enable the firewall.
5. Press `Y` and then `Enter` to confirm.

# Conclusion

You have successfully installed Wirow and set it up to start on boot.

From now on, your Wirow instance will be available on your subdomain (e.g. `https://conference.example.com`).

Thank you for using this tutorial!
