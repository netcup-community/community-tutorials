# Introduction
In this tutorial you will learn how to connect to a remote MySQL server (on a netcup vServer) through an SSH tunnel. The SSH tunnel allows up to do port-forwarding. In our scenario, we link the database port to us, which means that after the successful connection with the tunnel we access the database server through `127.0.0.1` and not the public IP.

But why should we do that?

Connecting through the SSH tunnel has two advantages:
1. We don't have to open a server port on the server. If we opened a port, it would be accessible to the entire internet.
2. The data is encrypted end-to-end through the SSH tunnel.

Both advantages clearly show that we are dealing with security issues here.

# Requirements 
We need the following:
* SSH access to the netcup server (vServer or Root-Server). 
* [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/). HeidiSQL is a free MySQL client that supports connecting through an SSH tunnel.
* A MySQL user with password. You can either use the root user or a previously set up new user.


### Why don't we use phpMyAdmin?

A good point. We don't use phpMyAdmin because phpMyAdmin runs on the server and we would have to open a port. This is exactly what we don't want.



# Step 1 - Change the network type

After starting HeidiSQL for the first time, you will see a screen similar to the one above, but probably without any entries. In the lower left corner above "new", you can add a new entry.

After creating a new session, you can set the following options on the right side in the "Settings" tab:

* Network type: `MariaDB or MySQL (SSH tunnel)`
* Library: Library that matches your server. libmariadb.dll for a MariaDB server or libmysql.dll for an MySQL server.
* Hostname / IP: `127.0.0.1`
* User: `root` or your newly created user
* Password: Password for that user
* Port: `3306`

Next we go to the 'SSH-tunnel' tab.

# Step 2 - SSH settings

In this tab we set the SSH configuration.

* First select the "Use SSH tunnel" checkbox.
* SSH executable: `plink.exe`
* SSH host + port: Here you set the public ip/hostname of your server and your SSH port.
* Username: your username for SSH login
* Password: your SSH password, skip this if you use a private key/public key method
* SSH timeout: 4 (default value)
* Private key file: Path to your private key, leave empty if not used
* Local port: `3307` (default value)

At the bottom left you can now save your changes via "Save".

# Conclusion 

You can now access your MySQL server through the SSH tunnel without opening any ports.
