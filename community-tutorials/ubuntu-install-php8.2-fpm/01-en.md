# Introduction
This tutorial describes how to install Apache2 with php8.2-fpm on an Ubuntu Server.
The tutorial has only been tested on Ubuntu 22.04, but should also work on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04.

# Requirements

* Server (Root or VPS) with Ubuntu Server 22.04.

# Step 1 - Check for system updates
Check your system for updates and install them by running this command:

```
apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```

# Step 2 - Install Apache2

Install Apache2 by running the following command:

```
apt-get install apache2
```

# Step 3 - Install PHP8.2-FPM

Because PHP8.2 is not yet included in the Ubuntu repository, we need to add the respective PPA repository by running:
```
add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
```

Next, update package sources:

```
apt-get update
```

Now, we will install PHP8.2 with some commonly used modules (bz2,curl,mbstring,intl,bcmath,xml,mysql,zip,gd,mbstring,imagick). You can add or remove modules if you already know your specific requirements:

```
apt-get install php8.2-{fpm,cli,bz2,curl,mbstring,intl,bcmath,xml,mysql,zip,gd,mbstring,imagick}
```

Next, enable the Apache2 php8.2-fpm confic, as well as the mods proxy_fcgi and setenvif by running:

```
a2enmod proxy_fcgi setenvif
a2enconf php8.2-fpm 
```

Restart Apache2:

```
systemctl reload apache2
```

Edit the following file by running:

```
nano /var/www/html/test.php
```

And add:

```
<?php
    phpinfo();
?>
```

Now, use a browser and head to http://ip_of_your_server/test.php \
Note that the server API should be FPM or FastCGI.

At this point, you have successfully installed Apache2 with php8.2-fpm. Note that the path of the php.ini is '/etc/php/8.2/fpm/php.ini'.

If you need, we can increase the memory limit and the maximum file size for uploads as well as other values by editing:

```
nano /etc/php/8.2/fpm/php.ini
```

```diff
- memory_limit = 128M
+ memory_limit = 256M
- upload_max_filesize = 2M
+ upload_max_filesize = 16M
- post_max_size = 8M
+ post_max_size = 16M
```

To apply the changes, restart php8.2-fpm:

```
/etc/init.d/php8.2-fpm restart
```

Now, verify the values via the test.php script.

# Step 4 - (Optional) Add a new virtual host

The server is only listening on IP. If you have a domain, we can add it as a new virtual host.
To do this, run:

```
mkdir /var/www/vhostname
nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/vhostname.conf
```

Insert the following content and replace vhost and yourdomain.de with your data:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName www.yourdomain.de
        ServerAlias yourdomain.de #Optional Alias the Server is listen too
        ServerAdmin webmaster@yourdomain.de
        DocumentRoot /var/www/vhostname

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/vhostname_error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/vhostname_access.log combined

        <Directory "/var/www/vhostname">
            AllowOverride All
        </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

You need to enable the virtual host and restart Apache2:

```
a2ensite vhostname
systemctl reload apache2
```

# Step 4.1 - (Optional) Install a TLS Certificate from Let's Encrypt

To secure your server via a TLS certificate, simply install Certbot:

```
apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-apache
```

Next, generate and install the TLS certificate by running the following command and following the steps provided. Please note that you will have to replace yourDomain.de,www.yourAlais.de with your specific data:
```
certbot --apache -d yourDomain.de,www.yourAlais.de
```

# Step 5 - (Optional) Enable HTTP/2 Protocol

If needed, you can easily enable the Apache2 HTTP2 Module by simply running:
```
a2enmod http2
systemctl restart apache2
```

# Conclusion

You have now installed Apache2 with PHP8.2-FPM. Optionally, you have also installed a TLS certificate with HTTP/2 Protocol. If you have multiple domains you can repeat Step #4 to add these domains. Please keep in mind that the server is not yet secure and you should take additional steps to ensure its security. This tutorial is only focused on the installation of Apache2 with php8.2-fpm.
