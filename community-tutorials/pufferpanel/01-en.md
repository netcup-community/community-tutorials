# Introduction

This tutorial explains how to install PufferPanel on a Debian or Ubuntu server (e.g. "RS 2000" server) and can set up an Apache2 reverse proxy.<br>
PufferPanel is a simple web panel for game servers and other things.<br>
I am doing this on a Debian 11 based server, but this tutorial should also work on other Debian versions and on Ubuntu.<br>
This tutorial is based on the PufferPanel docs found at https://docs.pufferpanel.com/en/2.x/installing.html, https://github.com/SanCraftDev/Debian-Setup/blob/main/README.md#Snapd and https://github.com/SanCraftDev/Debian-Setup/blob/main/README.md#Apache-and-Certbot.

# Requirements

You need a Debian or Ubuntu server with an internet connection. The server must be accessible via a static IP on ports `8080` and `5657`.<br>
You also need root permissions on the server. <br>
If you want to use HTTPS and a domain or subdomain, the server must be open to the internet on ports `80` and `443`. <br>
If you want to use PufferPanel for Minecraft servers, you must have Java 17 installed (see step 0).

# Step 0 - Installing Java (optional, necessary for Minecraft servers)

```sh
su
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
apt install gnupg software-properties-common wget curl sudo nano screen cron -y
wget -O- https://apt.corretto.aws/corretto.key | apt-key add -
add-apt-repository 'deb https://apt.corretto.aws stable main'
apt update; apt install java-17-amazon-corretto-jdk maven -y
```

# Step 1 - Installing the PufferPanel

First you need to connect to your server via SSH.<br>
Then switch to the root user and update your system. After that, proceed with the installation of PufferPanel:

```sh
su
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
apt install wget curl sudo nano screen cron -y
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/pufferpanel/pufferpanel/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
{ crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "* * * * * chown -R pufferpanel:pufferpanel /var/lib/pufferpanel/" ; } | crontab -
{ crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "* * * * * chown -R pufferpanel:pufferpanel /etc/pufferpanel/" ; } | crontab -
sudo apt-get install pufferpanel -y
```

If you want to automatically start PufferPanel on boot, enter this command:

```sh
systemctl enable pufferpanel
```

# Step 1.1 - Add a user & start PufferPanel

Now we add a PufferPanel user: <br>

```sh
pufferpanel user add
```

You will be asked to provide a username, your email address and a secure passphrase.

Now you can start PufferPanel for the first time:

```sh
systemctl start pufferpanel
```

You can access the panel via http://your-ip:8080.

# Step 2 - Install Apache2 (optional)

 - You need Apache2, PHP and MariaDB installed on your server see [here](https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/community-tutorials/install-web-server-mariadb-debian-php/01-en.md)
## Step 2.3 - Configuring PufferPanel

Create a subdomain or domain that is linked to your server. <br>
After that, you need to create an SSL certificate (replace DOMAIN with your domain or subdomain):

```sh
certbot certonly --apache -d DOMAIN
```

Next, create the Apache2 configuration file:

```sh
nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/0-pp.conf
```

Now paste the following into this file:

```
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName DOMAIN

    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
    RewriteRule .* ws://127.0.0.1:8080%{REQUEST_URI} [P]

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/pp.error.log

    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/privkey.pem
</VirtualHost>
```

- Replace every `DOMAIN` with your domain. <br/>
- Save your changes by pressing <kbd>CTRL + X</kbd>, then <kbd>y</kbd> and finally by hitting <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. <br/>
- Restart Apache2 with `service apache2 restart`. <br>

**Note:**
If you are doing this directly on a domain and NOT on a subdomain or you want to make the site available on more sites, I recommend adding a Server Alias to the Configuration like you see below. (If you want to make this site aviable on every Subdomain which looks the following `abc` you can also add as Server Alias `abc.*`.)
For this you need to regenerate the SSL certificate with `certbot certonly --apache -d DOMAIN,www.DOMAIN,web.DOMAIN,sub.DOMAIN`.<br/>

```diff
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName DOMAIN
+   ServerAlias status.* uk.DOMAIN

    ProxyPass / http://localhost:3001/
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
    RewriteRule ^/?(.*) "ws://localhost:3001/$1" [P,L]

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/uk-error.log

    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/privkey.pem
</VirtualHost>
```

You should now be able to open PufferPanel by accessing `https://DOMAIN/`.<br>

# Step 3 - Creating the first server

Additional screenshots below.<br>
Log in to your PufferPanel using your email address and password via http://your-ip:8080 or https://DOMAIN/ <br>
Go to `Templates` and import the templates you want to use or download some templates from https://github.com/SanCraftDev/PufferPanel-templates/blob/main/README.md <br>
Now go to `Servers`, press `+` and select the template you would like to use. Follow the steps, then select `Install` on the top left. Now you can start your server. <br>
Under `Admin` you can set your server to automatically start on boot. <br>
Do not forget to open the correct port of the server you created using PufferPanel, if an open port is needed (for example, a Minecraft server/proxy requires port `25565`, you can not use ports below `1024`).

# Step 4 - Run PufferPanel inside of a Docker container (optional)

First we need to install Docker:

```sh
apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc docker-compose -y
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
apt update && apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y
systemctl enable --now docker
```

Now we need to give PufferPanel access to Docker and restart PufferPanel:

```sh
sudo groupadd --force --system docker
sudo usermod -a -G docker pufferpanel
systemctl restart pufferpanel
```

# Conclusion
