# Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to install Uptime Kuma.

I am doing this on a Debian 11 server (RS Zimtstern) but the installation should also work on other Debian versions.

# Requirements

You need Apache2, PHP and MariaDB installed on your server, see [here](https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/community-tutorials/install-web-server-mariadb-debian-php/01-en.md).


## Installing Uptime Kuma

Uptime Kuma is an open source monitoring tool. [Here is a demo of it.](https://demo.uptime.kuma.pet)<br>
This tutorial is based on https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/master/README.md <br>

First, we need to install Docker by running the following commands:

```sh
apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc docker-compose -y
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
apt update && apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y
systemctl enable --now docker
```

Next, install Uptime Kuma with these commands:

```sh
docker volume create uptime-kuma
docker run -d --restart=always -p 3001:3001 -v uptime-kuma:/app/data --name uptime-kuma louislam/uptime-kuma:1
```

Now you can open Uptime Kuma by accessing http://IP:3001/ or http://DOMAIN:3001/ (you need to open Port 3001 to the internet beforehand).

## Step 1.1 - Apache setup (optional, but recommended)

In the following commands, replace every `DOMAIN` with your domain or subdomain.<br/>

- Generate an SSL certificate by running `certbot certonly --apache -d DOMAIN`. <br/>
- Run `nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/uk.conf`.<br/>

Now paste these lines into the file:

```
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName DOMAIN

    ProxyPass / http://localhost:3001/
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
    RewriteRule ^/?(.*) "ws://localhost:3001/$1" [P,L]

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/uk.error.log

    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/privkey.pem
</VirtualHost>
```

- Replace every `DOMAIN` with your domain and set a folder path under "DocumentRoot". All files in this folder will be available on your `DOMAIN` in the web.<br/>
- Save your changes by pressing <kbd>CTRL + X</kbd>, then <kbd>y</kbd> and finally by hitting <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. <br/>
- Restart Apache2 by executing `service apache2 restart`. <br>

**Note:**
If you are doing this directly on a domain and NOT on a subdomain, or if you want to make the site available on multiple subdomains, I recommend adding a server alias to the configuration as shown below. (If you want to make this site available on any subdomain that looks like `abc`, you can add `abc.*` as a server alias.)
For this you need to regenerate the SSL certificate with `certbot certonly --apache -d DOMAIN,www.DOMAIN,web.DOMAIN,sub.DOMAIN`.<br/>

```diff
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName DOMAIN
+   ServerAlias status.* uk.DOMAIN

    ProxyPass / http://localhost:3001/
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
    RewriteRule ^/?(.*) "ws://localhost:3001/$1" [P,L]

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/uk-error.log

    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN/privkey.pem
</VirtualHost>
```

### Step 1.2 - Update Uptime Kuma

Execute the following commands:<br/>

```
docker pull louislam/uptime-kuma:1
docker stop uptime-kuma
docker rm uptime-kuma
docker run -d --restart=always -p 3001:3001 -v uptime-kuma:/app/data --name uptime-kuma louislam/uptime-kuma:1
```
