# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of setting up a netcup root web server for hosting using Hestia Control Panel. Hestia Control Panel is a popular open source web server control panel that simplifies the management of your website, email accounts, databases, and other hosting-related tasks. This tutorial is compatible with both VPS and Root Server offerings by netcup.

The reading time of this tutorial is about 15 minutes; implementation will take approximately 45 minutes.

# Prerequisites

- A root server from netcup with latest Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/LTS; Debian 10/11/12/LTS or later installed (see the below URL) - use minimal mode of installation, also called clean installation.
```

```

- Please note latest Hestia Control Panel only supports the latest versions of the above OS. To know more visit:

```
- A registered domain name (optional)
- Root access to your server

# Step 1: Update your system

Before we begin, it's essential to ensure that your system is up-to-date. Log in to your server via SSH as the root user and run the following command:

For Ubuntu/Debian:

```
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

# Step 2: Install Hestia Control Panel

To install Hestia Control Panel, you'll first need to install the installation script. Run the following commands to download and to execute the installation script:

```
sudo cd /home && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hestiacp/hestiacp/release/install/hst-install.sh && bash hst-install.sh
```

Notes: If the download fails due to an SSL validation error, please be sure you've installed the ca-certificate package on your system - you can do this with the following command:

```
apt-get update && apt-get install ca-certificates
```

Note: To install with custom commands, use the script generator:

```
https://hub.io/hestiacp-scriptline-generator/
```

Options to use in command are:
```

```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. The installation process may take some time. Once it's complete, the Hestia Control Panel will be installed on your system.

# Step 3: Configure Hestia Control Panel

After the installation is complete, you can access the WHM (WebHost Manager) interface via your browser. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
https://your_server_ip:8083
```

Replace "your_server_ip" with the IP address of your server. You'll encounter a security warning since the SSL certificate is self-signed. Proceed to the website and log in with your root username and password you selected during the scrip installation.

Upon logging in, you'll be presented with the dashboard where you can view and configure the panel as per your needs.

# Step 4: Create a new user (regular)

On the dashboard, click the Add User button; fill out the fields; click the Save button in the top right.

To switch to the new user Hover over the user you want to login as; click the login as icon [ ->] ]' on the right of the userâ€™s name and email; you are now logged in as the user. As such, any action you perform will be done as this user.

Note: Never run a web or mail domain with the admin user -> By default, the admin user has elevated privileges. This can pose a security threat to your server!

# Step 5: Set up your domain

Navigate to "Web tab" > "Click the + Add Web Domain button" and enter your domain information.
Example: `exampledomain.com`

After creating a new account, you'll need to update your domain's nameservers to point to your server. This process varies depending on your domain registrar, so consult their documentation for instructions.

# Step 6: Create DNS Zone, eMail accounts & Databases

Click on the box labeled DNS & fill up the required details. A minimum of 2 name servers are necessary to avoid redundancy.

# Step 6: Upload your website files

To upload your website files, you can use the File Manager in Panel or an FTP client such as FileZilla. If using File Manager click on the File Manager icon on right top side and upload your files to the "public_html" directory under WEB > domain_name_folder > public_html.

![Upload Files](images/Upload_Files.png)

If using an FTP client, you'll need to create an FTP account in Panel first. Click on "WEB icon" > "domain name (edit domain)" > "Advanced Options" > click "Additional FTP account(s)" > fill in username, password and the default path & click "Save" to create a new account, then use the provided credentials to connect and upload your files.
