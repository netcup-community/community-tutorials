# Introduction

This tutorial describes how to set up an SMB share under Ubuntu 22.04 and automatically start it as a systemd service.

This tutorial does NOT describe how to provide an SMB share, but only how to connect (mount) it automatically!

The tutorial was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 (July 2023).

<hr>

Example values for this tutorial:
Value | Description
--- | ---
`smb.example.com/user/` | SMB share server (The server on which the SMB share is provided)
`/root/smb-share-mount/` | Mount point (The folder in which the SMB share should be mounted)
`password-example` | Password (The password with which you log in to the SMB share server)
`username-example` | Username (The username with which you log in to the SMB share server)

All these values must be replaced by your own values!

# Step 1 - Set up SMB share access data

First you have to log in to your server via SSH. (If you don't want to use your login user, you can also create a new user and log in with it.)

1. Move to the directory where you want to mount the SMB share using `cd`.
2. Enter `mkdir smb-share-mount` to create the folder for the SMB share.
3. Enter `nano .smbcredentials` and press `Enter` to create a new file.
4. Paste the following code into this file:

```bash
username=username-example
password=password-example
```

Please replace `password-example` with your password and `username-example` with the SMB share username.

5. Exit the file by pressing "Ctrl + X" and then "Y" and then "Enter".
6. Enter `chmod 600 .smbcredentials` to protect the access data file.

# Step 2 - Prepare server

1. Enter `sudo -s` to get root rights.
2. Enter your password and press `Enter`.
3. Now enter `apt update -y && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y && apt install -y cifs-utils keyutils` to update the server.
4. If a pink window appears, press `Enter` once to continue.

# Step 3 - Set up SMB share

1. Enter `nano /etc/systemd/system/smb-connect.service` and press `Enter` to create a new systemd service file.
2. Paste the following code into this file:

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Automatically connect to SMB share
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/root/
User=root
ExecStart=mount -t cifs -o credentials=/root/smb-share-mount/.smbcredentials //smb.example.com/user/ /root/smb-share-mount/
RemainAfterExit=true
Type=oneshot

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Replace `smb.example.com/user/` with the name of the server under which the SMB share is accessible.
4. Replace `/root/smb-share-mount/` (x2) with the path under which the SMB share should be mounted, - This is the folder in which you created the `smb-share-mount` folder earlier.
5. Exit the file by pressing "Ctrl + X" and then "Y" and then "Enter".
6. Enter `systemctl daemon-reload` to reload the systemd daemon.
7. Enter `systemctl enable smb-connect` to enable the service.
8. Enter `systemctl start smb-connect` to start the service.
9. Enter `systemctl status smb-connect` to check if the service is running.

# Conclusion

You have now set up an SMB share under Ubuntu 22.04 and started it as a systemd service.

Thanks for reading!
