# Introduction

This tutorial explains how to install and configure webhook by adnanh to trigger a shell script. Webhook by adnanh is a service written in Go that exposes a lightweight web server. When you call a specific route on the web server, you can run a command or shell script on your server. In the shell script, you can start a deployment or some other actions.

# Requirements

You need the package manager APT. You also need a text editor, for example vi or nano, to create and change config files.

# Step 1 - Updating your packages and installing webhook by adnanh

Run these commands:

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
sudo apt-get install webhook
```

Then check the version:

```
webhook -version
```

# Step 2 - Create the webhook configuration file

Create the webhook configuration file with a text editor of your choice:

```
vi /etc/webhook.conf
```

Paste the webhook configuration:

```
[
   {
      "id": "deploy-webhook",
      "execute-command": "/var/app/webhook-entrypoint.sh",
      "command-working-directory": "/var/app",
      "include-command-output-in-response": true,
      "include-command-output-in-response-on-error": true,
   }
]
```

Save the configuration file.

We defined only one webhook in an array in the JSON config file. Here we use the `execute-command` property to define the shell script path. The base path is defined in the `command-working` directory.
Later in this tutorial, we will execute our webhook with an HTTP request.
With the `include-command-output-in-response` property, the webhook will include the stdoutput of the shell script in the HTTP response body. With the `include-command-output-in-response-on-error` property, the webhook includes the erroutput of the shell script in the HTTP response body. The HTTP request waits until all the output is collected. If the exit code of the shell script is zero, the status code of an HTTP request is 200. If the exit code is not zero, the status code is not 200.
You have the option to remove the two "include-\*" properties, then you will not see the output of the shell script in the HTTP response body. For security reasons, it is recommended not to include the output in the HTTP response code.

# Step 3 - Create the app directory

Create the app directory:

```
mkdir -p /var/app
```

# Step 4 - Create the webhook-entrypoint.sh file and make it executable

Create a new file with a text editor of your choice:

```
vi /var/app/webhook-entrypoint.sh
```

Insert the following:

```
#!/bin/bash

echo 'Execute webhook-entrypoint.sh-script. Here you can do for example a deployment.'
```

Save the file.

Make the file executable:

```
chmod +x /var/app/webhook-entrypoint.sh
```

# Step 5 - Restart webhook service to activate all changes

IMPORTANT: If you make changes to your webhook configuration, you must restart the webhook service to activate all changes.
To activate the configuration run the command:

```
service webhook restart
```

# Step 6 - Test your webhook with a curl command

From the same server, you can test your webhook with the hostname "localhost":

```
curl http://localhost:9000/hooks/deploy-webhook
```

From a different server or your local computer, you can test your webhook with your server IP address:

```
curl http://<server-ip-address>:9000/hooks/deploy-webhook
```

The response of the HTTP request should look like:

```
Execute webhook-entrypoint.sh-script. Here you can do for example a deployment.
```

# Conclusion

You learned how to install and configure webhook by adnanh. With the webhook you can start a deployment on your server with a simple curl command from a different server or PC.
