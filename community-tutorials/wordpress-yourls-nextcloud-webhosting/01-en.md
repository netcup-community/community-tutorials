# Introduction
This tutorial will show you, how you can install Wordpress, YOURLS or Nextcloud on your netcup webhosting (plesk) <br>
I am doing this on webhoosting 4000, but it also should work on other webhoosting versions and plesk

# Requirements
You need an netcup webhosting panel or an plesk panel (or an )

# Step 0 - Plesk Login - Choose here your variant

## 0.1 - Nectup webhoosting
Just go to your [customercontrolpanel](https://www.customercontrolpanel.de/) and login <br>
Now click on "WCP Auto-Login", now select your webhosting and click "Auto-Login WEB"

## 0.2 - Plesk installed
Open Plesk over `https://<SERVER_NAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>:8443` and login <br>
Be sure to have the letsencrypt and wordpress extension installed

## 0.3 - Install Plesk
```sh
su
apt install curl wget
sh <(curl https://autoinstall.plesk.com/one-click-installer || wget -O - https://autoinstall.plesk.com/one-click-installer)
```
Open Plesk over `https://<SERVER_NAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>:8443` and login with root and your root password <br>
Be sure to install the letsencrypt and wordpress extension

# Step 1 - Adding the domain
First add your Domain or add an Subdomain (and create an ssl certificate over letsencrypt) <br>
Now go under "Files" to your directory of this domain

## Step 1.2 - Installing Wordpress
Wordpress is an open source website / bloggin software <br>
Go to "Wordpress" and press "Install", now set your settings and click "install", now wait until it is installed and now open wordpress over `https://<SERVER_NAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>/wp-login.php`

## Step 1.3 - Installing YOURLS 
YOURLS is an open source URL shorter with an web gui <br>
Click on "Databases" and click "Add Databases" now fill in the information and save the created data <br>
Now go under "Files" to your directory of this domain <br>
Now download the Source code (zip) from https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/releases/latest and unpack it and upload the content of the folder from the archiv <br>
Now we need to configure YOURLS <br>
Open the folder user on plesk and rename `config-sample.php` to `config.php` and open the `config.php` <br>
Now you need to set the following settings (you need to replace it in the second ''): <br>
Replace `'your db user name'` - with your database username name
```
/** MySQL database username */
define( 'YOURLS_DB_USER', 'your db user name' );
```
Replace `'your db password'` - with your database password
```
/** MySQL database password */
define( 'YOURLS_DB_PASS', 'your db password' );
```
Replace `'yourls'` - with your database name (username)
```
/** The name of the database for YOURLS
 ** Use lower case letters [a-z], digits [0-9] and underscores [_] only */
define( 'YOURLS_DB_NAME', 'yourls' );
```
Replace `'http://your-own-domain-here.com'` - with your URL
```
/** YOURLS installation URL
 ** All lowercase, no trailing slash at the end.
 ** If you define it to "http://sho.rt", don't use "http://www.sho.rt" in your browser (and vice-versa)
 ** To use an IDN domain (eg http://héhé.com), write its ascii form here (eg http://xn--hh-bjab.com) */
define( 'YOURLS_SITE', 'http://your-own-domain-here.com' );
```
Replace `'modify this text with something random'` - fill there in random letters and numbers
```
/** A random secret hash used to encrypt cookies. You don't have to remember it, make it long and complicated
 ** Hint: copy from http://yourls.org/cookie */
define( 'YOURLS_COOKIEKEY', 'modify this text with something random' );
```
Now you need to create a user and set its (secure) password - Replace `'username' => 'password', `
```
/** Username(s) and password(s) allowed to access the site. Passwords either in plain text or as encrypted hashes
 ** YOURLS will auto encrypt plain text passwords in this file
 ** Read http://yourls.org/userpassword for more information */
$yourls_user_passwords = [
	'username' => 'password',
	// 'username2' => 'password2',
	// You can have one or more 'login'=>'password' lines
];
```
Now save it <br/>
Now you can open YOURLS over https://DOMAIN/admin or https://SUBDOMAIN/admin and follow the shown steps and login

### Step 1.3.1 - Update YOURLS
Download the Source code (zip) from https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/releases/latest and unpack it and upload the content of the folder from the archiv and overrite it

### Step 1.3.2 - Installing a mordern Theme (Sleeky)
Download the Source code (zip) from https://github.com/Flynntes/Sleeky/releases/latest and unpack it and upload the `sleeky-backend` folder of the folder from the archiv in the user/plugin folder of your yourls installation <br>
Now go to https://DOMAIN/admin or https://SUBDOMAIN/admin and activate the sleeky plugin

## Step 2.3 - Installing Nextcloud - Optional
Nextcloud is an open source cloud software <br>
Click on "Databases" and click "Add Databases" now fill in the information and save the created data <br>
Now go under "Files" to your directory of this domain <br>
Download https://download.nextcloud.com/server/installer/setup-nextcloud.php and upload it there <br>
Now you can open Nextcloud over http://IP/setup-nextcloud.php, https://DOMAIN/setup-nextcloud.php or https://SUBDOMAIN/setup-nextcloud.php and follow the shown steps <br>
When you are asked for an database select MySQL/MariaDB and enter the database login data <br>
After you installed nextcloud you should make some more settings <br>
Open the .htaccess in this folder and go to the end of the file and add: `Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15552000"` <br>
Now save it <br/>
Now go in the folder config and open the config.php and add after `'installed' => true,`
```

  'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',
  'default_phone_region' => 'DE',
```
Change DE if you do not live in germany, look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) for the ISO code of your land and now save the file <br/>
Now you haved finished the nextcloud installation

# Conclusion
Now you have installed a wordpress, nextcloud or yourls <br>
