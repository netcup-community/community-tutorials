# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of setting up a netcup server for web hosting using cPanel. cPanel is a popular web hosting control panel that simplifies the management of your website, email accounts, databases, and other hosting-related tasks. This tutorial is compatible with both VPS and Root Server offerings by netcup.

The reading time of this tutorial is about 10 minutes; implementation will take approximately 45 minutes.

# Prerequisites

- A server from netcup with AlmaLinux, CloudLinux, RockyLinux or Ubuntu 22.04 or later installed (see the below URL) - use minimal mode of installation, also called clean installation.
```
https://docs.cpanel.net/installation-guide/system-requirements/
```

- Older OS verions like CentOS 7 is still allowed with forced installation in the script
```
--force — Force installation on an unrecommended configuration.
```

- Please note latest cPanel/WHM only supports the latest versions of the above OS. To know more visit:
```

```

- A registered domain name (optional)
- Root access to your server

# Step 1: Update your system

Before we begin, it's essential to ensure that your system is up-to-date. Log in to your server via SSH as the root user and run the following command:

For CentOS:

```bash
yum update -y
```

For Ubuntu:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

# Step 2: Install cPanel

To install cPanel, you'll first need to install the cPanel & WHM installation script. Run the following commands to download and to execute the installation script:

```bash
sudo cd /home && curl -o latest -L https://securedownloads.cpanel.net/latest && sh latest
```

Notes: The newer cPanel versions default to fast installation mode. It is recommended to disable the fast mode based on your requirements. You can use the option provided here:
```
https://docs.cpanel.net/installation-guide/customize-your-installation/
```

Few examples to use in command are:
```
--skip-wptoolkit — Skip the automatic installation of WP Toolkit.
--skip-cloudlinux — Skip the automatic CloudLinux conversion process even if a license exists.
--force — Force installation on an unrecommended configuration.
```

Updated command to run the script:
```
sudo cd /home && curl -o latest -L https://securedownloads.cpanel.net/latest && sh latest --skip-wptoolkit --skip-cloudlinux --force
```

The installation process may take some time. Once it's complete, cPanel & WHM will be installed on your VPS.

# Step 3: Configure cPanel

After the installation is complete, you can access the WHM (WebHost Manager) interface via your browser. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
https://your_server_ip:2087
```

Replace "your_server_ip" with the IP address of your server. You'll encounter a security warning since the SSL certificate is self-signed. Proceed to the website and log in with your root username and password.

Upon logging in, you'll be prompted to complete the Initial Setup Wizard. Follow the on-screen instructions to configure your server and create a new cPanel account.

# Step 4: Set up your domain

Once you've completed the Initial Setup Wizard, you'll need to set up your domain in WHM. To do this, navigate to "Account Functions" > "Create a New Account" and enter your domain information.

After creating a new account, you'll need to update your domain's nameservers to point to your VPS. This process varies depending on your domain registrar, so consult their documentation for instructions.

# Step 5: Create email accounts and databases

To log in to cPanel, enter ```https://your-server-ip:2083``` in your web browser and provide your login credentials (username and password).

With your domain set up, you can now create email accounts and databases for your website. To create an email account, navigate to "Email" > "Email Accounts" in cPanel.

To create a database, navigate to "Databases" > "MySQL Databases" in cPanel.

# Step 6: Upload your website files

To upload your website files, you can use the File Manager in cPanel or an FTP client such as FileZilla. If using File Manager, navigate to "Files" > "File Manager" and upload your files to the "public_html" directory.

If using an FTP client, you'll need to create an FTP account in cPanel first. Navigate to "Files" > "FTP Accounts" and create a new account, then use the provided credentials to connect and upload your files.

# Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up a server for web hosting using cPanel on netcup. You can now manage your website, email, and databases through the userfriendly cPanel interface. Remember to keep your server and cPanel updated to ensure consistent security and performance.
