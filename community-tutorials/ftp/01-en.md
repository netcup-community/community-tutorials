# Introduction
This tutorial explains how to install and configure a ProFTPD server on a Debian or Ubuntu server and how to secure your FTP connection (FTPS). <br>
I am doing this on a Debian 11 server (netcup RS 2000), but it should work on other Debian and Ubuntu versions as well.<br>
This is an advanced version of https://github.com/SanCraftDev/Debian-Setup/blob/main/README.md#proftpd

# Requirements
You need a Debian server with an internet connection that is accessible from the internet via a static IP on port 21.  <br>
You also need root permissions on your server.

# Step 1 - Installing ProFTPD
First, connect to your server via SSH. <br>
After that, we switch to the root user to update the system and afterwards we'll install the ProFTPD server.
```sh
su
apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
apt install wget curl sudo nano proftpd openssl -y
addgroup ftpuser
```
On Debian 11, you also have to run this command:
```sh
apt install proftpd-mod-crypto
```

## Step 2 - Configuring ProFTPD
Open the ProFTPD configuration file:
```sh
nano /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf
```

Press <kbd>CTRL + W</kbd> and enter `Group nogroup` to search for the desired line. Replace this line with `Group ftpuser`:
```diff
- Group nogroup
+ Group ftpuser
```

Press <kbd>CTRL + W</kbd> and enter `#Include /etc/proftpd/tls.conf` to search for the desired line. Replace this line with `Include /etc/proftpd/tls.conf`:
```diff
- #Include /etc/proftpd/tls.conf
+ Include /etc/proftpd/tls.conf
```

Now add this text at the beginning of the file:
```

<Global>
  RequireValidShell  off
  RootLogin  off
  DefaultRoot ~
</Global>
 
<Limit LOGIN>
  DenyGroup  !ftpuser
</Limit>
```
Save your changes by pressing <kbd>CTRL + X</kbd>, then by pressing <kbd>y</kbd> and finally by hitting <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. <br>


Open the ProFTPD modules file
```sh
nano /etc/proftpd/modules.conf
```
Now go to the beginning of the file and insert this line there:
```
LoadModule mod_tls.c
```

## Step 3 - Securing via SSL
To make the connection more secure we need to enable FTPS. <br>
For this, we first save the original FTPS configuration, create an SSL Certificate and then create the new configuration.
```sh
cd /etc/proftpd/
mv tls.conf tls.conff
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:8096 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/proftpd.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/proftpd.crt -nodes -days 999999
```
Now you are asked some questions which you can answer directly or by entering a period (`.`) <br>

```sh
chmod 0640 /etc/ssl/private/proftpd.key
```
Open the tls.conf:
```sh
nano tls.conf
```
And paste this text here:
```
<IfModule mod_tls.c>
TLSEngine                               on
TLSLog                                  /var/log/proftpd/tls.log
TLSProtocol                             SSLv123 TLSv1
TLSRSACertificateFile                   /etc/ssl/certs/proftpd.crt
TLSRSACertificateKeyFile                /etc/ssl/private/proftpd.key
TLSOptions                              NoCertRequest EnableDiags NoSessionReuseRequired
TLSVerifyClient                         off
TLSRequired                             on
TLSRenegotiate                          required off
</IfModule>
```
Now we need to restart ProFTPD:
```sh
service proftpd restart
```

## Step 4 - Creating an FTP user
In the next command, replace `USERNAME` with a valid username and `PATH` with the path to which the user should have access:
```sh
adduser USERNAME --shell /bin/false --home /PATH --ingroup ftpuser
```

# Conclusion
With the aid of this tutorial, you set up an FTP server with encryption. <br>
