# Requirements

This tutorial requires that you have set up your phpMyAdmin instance using the tutorial [Setup of phpMyAdmin with nginx and a Central Login](https://community.netcup.com/en/tutorials/phpmyadmin-with-central-login).

# Introduction

This tutorial describes how to install and activate a theme on a phpMyAdmin installation.

# Step 1 - Preparation of the server

First you have to log in to your server via SSH:

1. Enter `sudo -s` to get root rights.
2. Enter your password and press `Enter`.
3. Now enter `apt update -y && apt upgrade -y  && apt autoremove -y && apt install -y wget zip unzip` to update the server, remove all packages that are no longer needed, and install the program `wget`.

- If a pink window with the title "Pending kernel upgrade" appears, press `Enter` once to continue.
- If a pink window with the title "Daemons using outdated libraries" appears, press `Enter` once to continue.

# Step 2 - Selection of the theme

1. Open [phpmyadmin.net/themes](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/themes/) in your browser.
2. Select the version of your phpMyAdmin (you can find the version in the start page of phpMyAdmin in the "phpMyAdmin" panel under "Version information").
3. Choose a theme you like and right-click on "Download".
4. Click on "Copy link address".

# Step 3 - Downloading the theme

1. Enter `cd /usr/share/phpmyadmin/themes` to change to the folder where the themes are stored.
2. Enter `wget ` and then paste the copied link address. (Example: `wget https://files.phpmyadmin.net/themes/darkwolf/5.2/darkwolf-5.2.zip`)
3. Enter `unzip ` and then paste the name of the downloaded file. (Example: `unzip darkwolf-5.2.zip`)
4. Restart nginx by entering `systemctl reload nginx`.
5. Close the SSH connection.

# Step 4 - Activating the theme

1. Open your phpMyAdmin instance in your browser.
2. Click on the design dropdown right in the "Display settings" panel of the start page and select the theme you just installed.

# Conclusion

You have now successfully installed and activated a phpMyAdmin theme.

Thank you for using this tutorial!
