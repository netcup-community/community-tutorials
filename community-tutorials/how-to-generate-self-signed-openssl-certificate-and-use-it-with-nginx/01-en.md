# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to generate a self-signed certificate and use it with an nginx web server on a Debian Linux system. The self-signed certificate will be valid for 365 days. To run nginx, we will use a helpful tool, namely Docker. In the Docker container we will include the configuration file and the generated public key pair files.

# Requirements

You need a virtual server from netcup with Debian or Ubuntu installed. Also, this tutorial requires a Docker setup. For instructions on setting up Docker on Ubuntu, see the netcup community tutorials.

# Step 1 - Check your Docker version

Check your docker version:

```
sudo docker -v
```

The output should look like the following, although version and build may be different:

```
Docker version 20.10.10, build b485636
```

# Step 2 - Install OpenSSL and curl

Run the following command to install OpenSSL and curl:

```
sudo apt-get install openssl curl
```

# Step 3 - Create an SSL Certificate with OpenSSL

Create the self-signed certificate:

```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out public.crt -keyout private.key
```

You need to answer some questions on the command line about the certificate, such as questions about your website or about your organization. Normally, a self-signed certificate is used for a private use case, so the information is not that important.

For example, you can enter these values and press Enter after each answer:

```
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:DE
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Berlin
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Berlin
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Test Company Name
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Test Organisation Unit
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:your-netcup-domain.net
Email Address []:test-email-address@your-netcup-domain.net
```

In the next lines you find a description of all the OpenSSL options used in this command:

- -newkey rsa:4096: Create a 4096 bit RSA key, which is used for the certificate. RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is the cryptography algorithm and 4096 the generated key size in bit.

- -x509: Create a self-signed certificate.

- -sha256: Request of the certificate generation using 256-bit SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)

- -days: Defines how many days the certificate is valid. In the case of a self-signed certificate, this value can be very low or very high.

- -nodes: Don't require a passphrase. If you remove this option, you have to enter the passphrase in the commandline each time the application starts.

# Step 4 - Create a file with static content

Use a text editor of your choice to create an index.html file in the current directory:

```
vi index.html
```

Insert the following:

```
<html>
<head></head>
<body>Hello World!</body>
</html>
```

Save the file.

# Step 5 - Create the nginx configuration with SSL

Use a text editor of your choice to create the `default.conf` configuration file in the current directory:

```
vi default.conf
```

Insert the following:

```
server {
   listen 443 ssl;
   server_name _;

   ssl_certificate /etc/certs/public.crt;
   ssl_certificate_key /etc/certs/private.key;

   location / {
      root /usr/share/nginx/html;
   }
}
```

Save the configuration file.

# Step 6 - Start a container with nginx

The following command creates a new container with the base nginx:1.21.4 image and mounts various volumes into the container. If the base image doesn't exist in the local registry, Docker will pull the image first.
Run the following command to start a new container named nginx:

```
docker run -d --name nginx \
    -p 443:443 \
    -v $(pwd)/public.crt:/etc/certs/public.crt \
    -v $(pwd)/private.key:/etc/certs/private.key \
    -v $(pwd)/index.html:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html \
    -v $(pwd)/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf nginx:1.21.4
```

# Step 7 - Check the status of the container

To check the status of the created container, run this command:

```
docker ps -a
```

The output should look like this:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                            NAMES
d2c2c05b2a64   nginx:1.21.4                      "/docker-entrypoint.…"   54 seconds ago   Up 52 seconds   80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, :::443->443/tcp    nginx
```

# Step 8 - Test the web server with curl

Run this command on the command line:

```
curl --insecure https://localhost:443
```

The output should look like this:

```
<html>
<head></head>
<body>Hello World!</body>
</html>
```

# Step 9 - Test the web server with your browser

Open you browser and enter the URL but don't forget to change the IP address: `https://<ip-address-of-your-netcup-server>:443`.

Your browser displays a warning page. To accept the warning, click on "Expanded" and then on "Accept risk and continue".

Now you should see the message "Hello World!".

# Step 10 - Cleanup the container and remove all files

```
sudo docker stop nginx
sudo docker rm nginx
rm public.crt
rm private.key
rm index.html
rm default.conf
```

# Conclusion

You learned how to generate a self-signed certificate and how to configure nginx to use the generated public key pair. You also learned how to start nginx in a Docker container and mount various files into the container. Self-signed certificates can be valid for a very long period of time, for example, more than a year. You can specify the number of days in the command line.
