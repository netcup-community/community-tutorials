# Introduction

Creating a new user account in Linux can be done easily using the command line interface. In this tutorial, we will go through all the steps that are required to create a new user account in Linux.

# Requirements

Before starting, you should have the following:

- Access to a Linux machine with sudo privileges
- Basic knowledge of the Linux command line interface


# Step 1 - Open the terminal

To create a new user account, we need to use the command line interface. Open the terminal by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+T` on your keyboard or by searching for "Terminal" in the application launcher.

# Step 2 - Create a new user account

To create a new user account, we will use the `useradd` command. The basic syntax of the `useradd` command is as follows:

``` bash
sudo useradd username
```

Replace `username` with the desired username for the new user account. For example, to create a new user account named `john`, use the following command:

``` bash
sudo useradd john
```

By default, the new user account will not have a password and will not be able to log in to the system. To set a password for the new user account, use the `passwd` command as follows:

``` bash
sudo passwd john
```

Enter and confirm the new password when prompted.

# Step 3 - Add user to groups

By default, the new user account will not have any special privileges or permissions. To add the new user account to a specific group, use the `usermod` command as follows:

``` bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```

Replace `groupname` with the name of the group you want to add the user to, and `username` with the username of the new user account. For example, to add user `john` to the `sudo` group, use the following command:

``` bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo john
```

# Conclusion

Creating a new user account in Linux is a simple process that can be executed from the command line interface. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can create a new user account and, if desired, grant administrative privileges.
