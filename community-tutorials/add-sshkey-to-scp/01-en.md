# Introduction
This tutorial describes how to generate an SSH key and store it in the SCP.
The saved SSH key can be used for future image installations.

# Requirements

* Computer running MacOS / Linux / Windows (10 or 11) 
* Server (Root or VPS)

# Step 1 - Generate the SSH key

Open a terminal.
Generate the SSH key using the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```
Define the location of the SSH key.
The default setting is `~/.ssh/id_rsa` ( ~ points to the home folder of your current user ).
A password for the key can be entered optionally. It is recommended to protect your key with a password.

5. Copy the content of the public key from the previously created SSH key and paste it into the form.


# Conclusion

The SSH key can now be used for your server installation.

You no longer need to copy the key by yourself each time you perform an image installation.
