# Introduction

This tutorial describes how to set up a Linux Server with rootless docker. 
The reading time is about some minutes for this tutorial; implementation will take a little bit longer. ;)
The most important requirement for implementation is a basic understanding of linux and command line. This tutorial were tested on a Debian 11 and Ubuntu 20.04 serversystem.
If you install a docker instance it is possible for a container to use the root privileges, so it is better to install docker with the privileges of a normal user and so no container ist allowed to enter the host.
In this tutorial I install docker-rootless with a user called "<UserName>" with uid "1000" but you can use every username you want.

# Requirements

You need following requirements:

* The simplest VPS from netcup is all you need, in this tutorial I used a VPS 2000 G9
* Debian or Ubuntu iso
* If you wanna install more container you need some disk capacity

# Step 1 - Ordering the VPS

Order your server you want maybe a https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2948

# Step 2 - Basic configuration of the server

After ordering the server install debian or ubuntu at https://www.servercontrolpanel.de/
You need your username and your password to login
after that choose your server 
on left side `media`
on the right hand there is the section `dvd media`
now choose your ditri of your choise `ubuntu or debian`
a new section appers
set boot mode to DVD  --> yes
retype your password from account
install distri of your choise set your user + password (for debian set your root password)

Now set up SSH like this tutorial

https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/community-tutorials/use-ssh-key-login/01-en.md

because every step is easy with SSH

# Step 3 - Update the system and install prerequisites

ssh <UserName>@<YourServer>

Login with user
and get the SuperUser privileges (Debian root)

```bash
su - #for debian
sudo su #for ubuntu

apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade -y
apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    iptables \
    openssh-server \
    software-properties-common \
    sudo \
    uidmap \
    unzip \
    wget \
    -y
```
for Debian we need a little more

```bash
apt-get install \
                dbus-user-session \
                fuse-overlayfs \
                slirp4netns \
                -y
```
Now we are setting our user to sudo group

```bash
usermod -aG sudo <UserName> #username your choose before
```
Now we create some little configÂ´s to prevent some errors 

to prevent this error 

    [rootlesskit:parent] error: failed to start the child: fork/exec /proc/self/exe: operation not permitted

we have to set the following option in `/etc/sysctl.d/docker_rootless.conf`

```bash
 echo -e "kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1" > /etc/sysctl.d/docker_rootless.conf
 sysctl --system
 modprobe overlay permit_mounts_in_userns=1
```

If you wanna install redis you need to edit `/etc/sysctl.conf`

```bash
echo "vm.overcommit_memory = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
```

Now reboot the system and login with <UserName>

# Step 4 - Install docker 
Now we login with the <Username> 

ssh <UserName>@<YourServer>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh
```
after the download and installation docker ist ready to run
Test ist with

```bash
docker -v
```
If you read something like this 

```bash
    Docker version 20.10.14, build a224086
```
everything is fine

Now we are setting the variables in the .bashrc you have to user your user and UID
```bash
# Docker environment variables
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/home/<UserName>/.docker/run
if [[ ! $(echo $PATH | grep /home/UserName/bin) ]]; then
    export PATH=/home/<UserName>/bin:$PATH
fi
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/UserNameUID/docker.sock
```
If docker need priviligierte ports (<1024) we have to enable it with SuperUser rights and the command
Debian `Su -`
Ubuntu `sudo`
```bash
setcap cap_net_bind_service=ep /home/UserName/bin/rootlesskit
```
# Step 5 - Install docker compose

Now we wannt install docker-compose to easily rollout container 
Use SuperUser privileges
```bash
su - (Debian)

sudo `for` Ubuntu
    curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.2.6/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
```

After this steps you are able to setup up your docker enviroment. With docker compose or only setup up some standalone docker container.
