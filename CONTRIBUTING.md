## netcup Community Tutorial Guidelines
# General Criteria
- Tutorials should be in English. 
- Name the product you're using.
   - Whether it is Webhosting or a vServer you are using in your tutorial, please make sure to name it. (e.g.: Webhosting 4000)
- Make sure your tutorials work on new servers.
   - If someone just ordered a new server, they should not first have to install or configure anything, except it is explained in your tutorial. In this case, make sure there is already a tutorial explaining that and link to the corresponding tutorial at the beginning of yous.
- Write in a structured, easy to follow manner.
   - Since your content will be read by users with a wide range of experience, make sure beginners can still follow.
   - If you use acronyms, write them out the first time you use them.
   - If you use a word, that probably not everybody understands, explain it. Or, use a different easier to understand word or phrase.
   - Don´t skip steps. Some might seem obvious or self-explanatory to you, but aren't to others.
   - Don´t overdo insider jokes. (Looking over to you, dear "Duck-Community". :wink:)
- Be the original.
   - We will not accept tutorials that can be found anywhere else on the web, especially if not in context with netcup.
   - Make sure your tutorial is new to the collection. In case it's not, have a look if it would be a valid expansion of an existing tutorial. In case you found one, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

# Structure
All of your Tutorials should have the same basic structure:

- Title
- Introduction
- Steps
- Conclusion
## Title
The title should be a summary that gives users an immediate idea of what the tutorial is about. e.g. Installing <software> on <Operating System>

 ## Introduction
The first few sentences are here for you to explain what your tutorial is about. Make sure to be on point with what users will end up with when they finished your tutorial. Also: let them know if there are special requirements! Link other tutorials that your tutorial builds on, and add recommendations for what users should know.

## Steps
Now we're right in the heart of the tutorial where users will follow every single one of your (foot)steps.
The amount of steps will vary depending on how long or complicated your tutorial is.

Remember: none of the users walked that road before, so make sure to really explain your steps well.
Each of them should build on the previous one. It is important not to skip any steps, no matter how obvious or self-explanatory they may seem! (If you're not sure what we mean here, you might want to watch this fun video.)

## Conclusion
Once all steps are completed you might want to add a short conclusion.
You can either summarize what has been done or give the user an overview of what to do next.

# Code Example
You can create code examples in nearly every programming language. Just state the language after the first three backticks in your Markdown file.

``` js
var x, y, z;
x = 5;    
y = 6;   
z = x + y;  // Comment
document.getElementById("tutorial").innerHTML = "The value of z is " + z + ".";
```

# Template
For all of this we provided a template for you. See https://github.com/netcup-community/community-tutorials/blob/main/TEMPLATE.md

It includes:

- a basic layout for your tutorial,
- some examples of formatting
- tips and tricks for setting everything up.
